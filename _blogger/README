The export of the old blogger posts

archives contains all the posts from the archives, I beleive this has
everything except for the 16 draft posts, which I am planning on moving by
hand to the _posts directory. 

If you ever want to merge these in you will want to find the ones that exist
here but don't exist in the main _posts directory. You should know that there
were multiple posts on some days and the dates may not line up, or could have
been clobbered in my original attempt to export the blogger data.
