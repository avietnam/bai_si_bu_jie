November 14, 2002.

Well I am feeling much better.  Kelly took me to the urgend care center on Sunday because I was not feeling better.   I was convinced it was a sinus infection. The doctor seemed to agree, and she gave me Zithromax.  My flem wnet from dark yellow to clear in 24 hours!  I finally finished that percription today, and I am feeling much better.  Unfortunally Kelly has now come down with the same thing.  Her Doc said it was a viral laryngitis.  But she got antibiotics that she could go get if she didn't feel better in a few days.  Well she didn't, so she started taking them last night.  Hopefully she will get better soon.  She has been talking like a frog, and now her ears and throat have been hurting more.  Poor girl.

Oh, you know the other really wierd thing, her temperture was 92 degrees.  Isn't that insane?  I didn't know what that means, I mean, it's nto a cold, it's like she's running a colder or something.  The nurse and doctor didn't seem to think it was very strange.  But I sure do.  I guess she wasn't kidding all those time when she was fussing about being cold.  

I talked to Jason last night on the phone.  I was working pretty late and he called my cell phone.  After trying for a wile to talk in my cube I finaly wondered outside into the cold where I got a good reception.  Apperently he is flying to costa rica for a week and a half to see his woman.  Very cool.  So he is gonna crash at our place before he leaves.  Crazy thing is it is the same day I am getting wisdom teeth surgery, but his flight leaves a few hours before my appointment.  Only bad thing about this arrangement is I am gonna want to eat then -- but I have to go 6 hours with no food or drink.

Man.  I am a little worried about my wisdom teeth extraction -- the dentist I went to really scared me.  However this oral surgon was very confident and seem to know what he was talking about.  He gave me little reason for concern.  I talked to my parents last night and my Mom was trying to talk it down.  it almost made it worse, like she was trying to talk me into it not being bad.  Plus she was the one insisting that I wait it out for the teeth to come out and now they are impacted.  I really wish we could have done this 6 years ago when the dentist was telling me to get it done.  

I don't know fi I mentioned it before, but Jimmy had bought Mr. Wolf's old wileys jeep, not now he is married and dosent want it anymore, so my father and jason took it to grandpa john's farm and put it in the barn.  Well it was kinda being kept there and jimmy wanted $1200 for it.  However I dont' really have that sorta cash right now for another toy that would require alot of work and money to get in working order.  So I told Jason my woes about spending alot of money on my Jeep for reoutene maintanance and brakes -- it was over a thousand dollars in work these last two months.  Pretty annoying.  Anyway, I told them that if jimmy can sell it that he should go ahead and do so.  I don't want to get into the thing where I pay him in installments.  Not gonna have another fiasco like I had with Everett.

I think I told you about how I sold Everett Kelly's old Civic.  Well I offered to sell it to him for $1000.  He talked me up to $1200.  I meand blue book was a good $3500.  He told me he would pay me in a week.  I said deal. He then said he would pay in two installments of $600.  Ugh.  So in a week I went to meet him and he forgot the checks.  Damn.  You know what?  I could spell this out in vivid detail, but I will just include the emails discussion we had, it should be pretty clear:

TODO: Cut 'n Past the emails!!!!

On a happy note, it looks like my friend from Kansas is coming for a visit.  I have never actually met Dean, only chated with him online for some time now, over a year I think.  He trains with a former professional wushu lady out there in Kansas City, Shao Li.  I also helped out with some of the logo stuff for the school and we talk wushu all the time.  I guess he has some vacation days so he is flying in to DC for the weekend.  I am gonna take him to O-Mei for a couple of classes, probably the friday class and the saterday class.  He will be here the weekend of December 7th and 8th, so we will also be able to go out with some old USWA buddies for Glen and my birthday that night.  Overall I think it will be a good weekend.  He is flying into national around 2pm, so he is just down the street from my office and hopefully I will be able to take off early that day to go pick him up.  It's almost too bad he wants to go to O-Mei that night, we could hang around in Old Town an dhave a great old time.

In conclusion:  Ice both legs.  I iced the leg that felt the worst after wushu last night.  That leg hurts much less than the other one now.  so in the future do both.
