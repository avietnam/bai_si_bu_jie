Chris Documentation Project

I have a few reasones for doing this.  Prolly the most pressing one is that I am convinced that I am gonna forget some of the really cool things that have happened to me.  I want to remember all the people and places and things I have experianced.  Also I remember when My best friend Everett wrote his autobiography out in green marker, that was one fo the greatest things I have ever read.  I was truly impressed.  So I want to do a similar project, I journal/diary of sorts.  I am planning on going back to highschool at least in this, but I will need to sit down and figure out the timeline of stuff to some extent.  Not like the order is important or anything, but I need to brainstorm over the events that occured.  As for college, I think I am gonna get Kelly (my wife) to help me out -- she can draw up an outline for me and I can do the writeup or something.  

Man oh man, I don't know where to start.  I want this to be readable by anyone with know knowledge of me at all, but I don't wanna start at the beginnign because of my lack of preperation. I guess I could do the preperation now, but i want something solid accomplished.  I have a few hours today I can write, I don't plan on writing for that long in the future, I just want to go back and get some of this stuff down.  then I can just transistion the project to a daily/weekly journal of the events that have happened to/around me.  

I think this project will have to be more of a event/person driven flow rather than a time driven flow.  What I mean is I will write up the stories of certian things or people in my life.  So I am gonna write about some of my good friends first, from when I met them to now, this otta not leave too many gaps, and later I can just refer the these stories.  This way I can get things rolling, later I will just switch to a journal type entrys.  Man, I hope I can keep this going.  I really wanna comeback and read everything in my oldage to remember all the adventures I have had.  I love adventures.
