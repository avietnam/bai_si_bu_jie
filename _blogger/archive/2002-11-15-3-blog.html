November 1, 2002.

Turns out alot of my concerns from my lst entry were subduded in the few days following. We got calls from a number for people.  I still have not heard form peter, but the gonzagas calld us -- and so did glenn and tom and a few more.  That was really nice.  We have missed each other in passing a few times but there was at least some effort put out to try to see everyone.  Beej and Katie are even suposed to come over and watch the VT football game this weekend.  

Tonight Kelly is gonna jump on the metro and come out to Alexandria to see a movie.  We are gonna meet up with Josh and see iSpy. or is it I Spy.  ionno.  iSpy just has a cool mac sound to it.  

My shins are acting up, and I have a new drive to get my tornado kicks to a higher level.  That really sucks when you wanna train so bad, but it only makes you hurt more.  My tonados are better these days, but I feel like my front jump snap kicks are getting low and sloppy. I really need to drill them.  But I also really need my shins to be in good condition when I go to china.  

Right now the plan is to still go in Febuary.  Everyone keeps telling me how cold it is gonna be, but at this point it is cold china or the chance of no china.  Everything is setup.  I need to send the program payment to Morgan Li this month, and still gotta get my Visa and Plane ticket, but the travel agency told me I was in no hurry because the prices are not gonna change too much in the next few months.  Apperenly no one goes to china in Febuary.  Hmmmm, maybe there is a reason for that.

I just go the t-shirts and stickers I made for Peking Duck form cafe press.  They are pretty nice, I hope they will last for a while but I am happy with what they look like.  I love the Duck head logo, but Duanne's Ducktacon looks pretty sweet on a shirt.  No telling when we will make the next movie.  I hope it won't be too long, but I do really need to get started on the DVD.  I need that ready by Christmas because it is our planned present to 50% of the people we know.  I have to start doign research for the menus. Guess I will have to watch a bunch of DVD's so I can look at their menus.
