Well it's the 21st of October and the Washington DC Sniper has been running around sense the 2nd.  Things are seeming crazy, but I think I have started to get used to it.  Kelly is very high strung and reads the Word and prays every night in order to get to sleep.  At first she was ok, but after 4 or five deaths she started to really worry.  I beleave her when she says she is more scared of me getting shot than her death.  This weekend Nikki was suposed to com visit from Radford, but my parents didn't want her to come up with all the shootings -- instead they wanted her go go visit them, and guess where the next shooting was?  Richmond.  Well, just north of Richmond, in Ashland VA. This is all too scary.

Moving on to more happy stuff.  I had my first chinese test and I wound up with a 96, I was pretty happy -- but I really was trying to ace the test.  I studied for a good 2 weeks for it.  But Chinese School is going well.  My Wushu class is sorta dwindling -- my kids are loosing intrest, but I seem to have a pretty good group.  Most are either 6 or 7 years old, but I have a few that are older.  The older ones are wonderful.  I guess when you have been dealing with kids who really cannot stand on one spot and pay attention the moment when you have someone remember the form from week to week it is always gonna seem wonderful.  I wish I chould get some of the older kids, like teenaged ones, but once they walk in and see all the 6 year olds they split.  Oh well, in a few years my kids will be teenagers.  

Kelly and I are getting a little discuraged about our friends.  It really seems like we are bugging those that are still close to us and all the others are just moving on and forgetting that we exist.  I feel like if I just didn't call anyone -- and waited for them to call me -- that i would only get calls form my parents.  I know sean would call, so he is an exception.  But kelly feels that she is even being a burden to Jeannie.  I understand jeannie is busy, but I really wish she would call kelly more.  I mean, I know she is not the calling type, and kelly is, however I am searching for some reassurance that kelly (and me) are not just annoying to her.  We have been trying to seem paulo and mel for a while, and that is just getting harder and harder.  I am convinced that if I stoped pushing to see them that I would never see them again.  Same with peter.  He was like my best friend for a while there.  I really dont' want him to drop out of my life, but I feel that he would look at the situation and decide that I am not a priority and while he would not do any thing directly to hurt me we will simply never see each other again.  That really sucks.  I miss peter quite a bit.  But I honestly think he would never call me to go do anything.  I hope I am wrong.  It was the weekend before last (I think) and I called him to grap dinner or the like, and he said he would rather go home and read for the afternoon/night.  I was very offended, of course I said that was fine, but deep down it really hurt.  I mean, he was gonna go read star wars novels, the romance smut novel of the geeks.  Back before I left USWA, he responded to my fear of loosign him as a friend by saying he would stay my friend.  I didn't mean he would decide to be unfriendly, but that we would never be able to see each other again.  Dammit, if I knew I was gonna loose peter this easy I might have stayed.  I miss hanging out with him.  I know kelly does too.  STAR WARS novels.  Geez.  Oh, I sent him like 3 emails trying to get him to come ot KElly's Birthday party, and I know that it was during the week and he prolly had class, but he didn't call or respond or anything.  Perhaps he is the one that tipped zhang gui feng off to her party.  (ZGF asked glenn about kelly's birthday party).

While I am ranting about friends that never call me (I guess it would be mroe polite to say: that I have to call if I ever want to see again) Beej has gotten engaged to katie.  Which I think is good, she actually proposed to him.  So she redeemed herself from turning him down a few times in the past.  Now if I could only do something to convince him that I am worth hanging out with.  I think katie dosent think too highly of me.  This is depressing.

Oh, in exciting news I have applied to Cirque du Soleil.  It is for a martialarts posistion in a permanent show in Las Vegas.  I spent a while and made a demo video and some pictures and sent off an application package.  I really feel like I am way out of my league with those people, but I am hopeful that I will get a responce.  So I will cross my fingers and pray.  Pray and train hard -- as if I had an audition on the way.  This would be a dream come true in so many ways.  

Alrighty, I am off to figure out ways to convince people that they want to hang around me bad enough that they would call me.  but I need to do it with out pestering them.  hmrm.
