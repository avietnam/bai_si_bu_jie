I will need to go back and fill you in on the state of the movie.  It is really making progress.  Wish I could indlude the video clips from it in here.

Anyway.

USWA is stagnet.  The coaches are not showign any signs of change and my contract there is running out.  I had planned to renew and pay it all up front so that I could show I am the bigger man and loyal to those I train with.  But I started thinking about it and began to think that is not such a good idea.  I mean I was so close to beign kicked out and things really havent changed from then.  I think I am gonna leave.  I feel dirty for wanting to go to O-Mei, but that is prolly because I have been conditioned to think that way. 

Kelly is surprising me.  My contrack it up on the 17 of July - in a week or two.  Hers however runs till January.  She wants to stay.  I really hope she can do it.  I mean, not even stay the entire time, but just long enough to test for Sword and learn Chang Quan.  Plus she will help keep us in touch with all our friends we have there.  Needless to say I am very impressed with my Wife.  I didn't expect that at all -- after all those times the coaches have made her cry in class too.  She amazes me.

So I think I am gonna do it.  I am gonna go to that other school.  I am gonna be called a trator at USWA.  Man, I loved that place.  I hate to think of it that way.  But if the coaches are the type of people that will talk about me behind my back why should I continue to support them.  I mean I want to make Wushu my life, and my wushu coach is a major part of my future carrer.  I understand that coach pei will not talk to me because he will not associate with people who he does not approve of.  I am thinking I don't want to associate with people that refuse to forgive.  Or insist on a first strike your out policy.  He should be flattered that I woudl leave his school because I don't want to associate with him, in a way you could say I learned it from him.  I learned alot of really good things from that man -- ways to act in the martial arts world, policies to enforce, teachign techniques.  But in the past few months I have also been given a lesson on what not to do.  I remember in Febuary the coaches were telling me that they treat everyone equal.  Now they have a new theory, the inner circle policy.  If you are in their inner circle (ie. are currently doign them favors) then they will help you.  If not you are second on the list.  

The Circle.

Coach Z has even been point blank and said to Philip and Glenn that if they stay in the circle she will help them more (as in teach more).  She has even gotten into the habbit of saying who is in and who is out of the circle.   I am out, way out.  Glenn even needed help with a demo and listed me as a possibility, but coach told him he can't use me.  Man.  I am gonna miss training with those people.  I don't wanna go, but I think I will be miseriable if I stay.  Getting by on the bare minum that the coaches feel obligated to give me (and they are by far the most expensive school in town).  I simply refuse to submit my self to the authority of such hypocritical people. I still love them, and I hope they could one day find it to forgive me for the things they think I have done agenst them.  but I was only trying to help.  If I had other motives I would have left along time ago. I hope some how they will know that.

You know what I am wrried about when I wrote those last few sentences.  That people would not buy it, say it sounds like I am the floofy/wishy-washy/preach-the-big-stuff-but-act-diffrent kinda guy.  That I will claim I am only trying to help but hav emy own motives.  I mean I know the times when I was that way (like when suzie said I was trying to make her look bad, and I responded with "oh no, I never would do that"  that was not true.  I was mad at her, and wanted others to be too.  Still, I wish we could be friends again)  I mean I guess I shouldnt worry about that.  People are not suposed to be reading this in the first place.  So you better stop reading and forget everything I already told you!

Well I am determined to show the coaches what the missed out on.  I am going to get good.  I want to be one of the best, I don't know how.  but I am gonna go for it.  I know there are many more people with natural talent much higer than mine, but I am not gonna let that stop me.  They want one thing, to have good students to show off, I am determined to get good enought that they have to tell their friends that I am that good bacause of them, dispite what they really know.


Lets move on.  I could type about them all day.  and I really shoudl stop dwelling on the situation at USWA.  Soon I will be wearing Black and Yellow.  \*gasp\*  

We reshot the school scene this last weekend.  It was fun.  We had Beej out for his second shooting with us.  I dont' know if I prefer Beej to Paulo filming or not.  Paulo has better ideas for what motion is good, but beej seems to shoot better quality (however less imagnative) footage.  

The school fight scene is the final fight in disk (working title).  So we were determined to make it good.  We shot it once on the first weekend we filmed, but that was after a few hourse behind the golds gym for the alley scene.  It lacked the flavor we wanted -- so we started over.  Now it has a bit more jackie chan style to it. The Tie Fight scene was great, I just hope it edits together well.

The Butterfly twist fall...I was pratcint it for a good two weeks getting ready.  most of the takes didnt hurt at all, but the good shots brused pretty good.  We had one nice take -- was planning to use it inthe final for sure -- and it got taped over!  man I was so mad.  I went back right away and reshot it with Duanne and Glenn, you can tell the lighting is diffrent, but I am gonna try to cover that up in editing.  I don't think the shadows will be that noticable.  In addition we are gonna hve to go back in a week or two to get a few transistions that we missed.  Nothing major, should be really quick. 

Well this weekend was pretty fun, we filmed on saterday, and went into DC on sunday for the Silk Road Festival.  That was really quite cool, Sean Glenn and I even found Rene down there.  Gotta see some cool Chinese Opera and I got a few Au Batido Pictures in DC.  The crappy thing was Kelly being out of town.  She had to fly to TX at the last min because her grandfather died.  She was pretty stressed about it I think.  

I could tell that the biggest problem she was having with her Grandfather passing away was the fact that she had been mad at him for the way he treated her grandmother.  I know she didn't get much time there to morn him, and I know her family dosent want to talk about it.  I don't blame them really, I know when Grandpa John Died I just wanted to pretend he was still here, and everything was fine.  I still don't feel like he is gone.  I guess it is better that way -- for me.

It does seem like kelly needs to vent about it, needs people who will talk to her and be sad with her.  I never really knew her grandfather so I don't think I am that person.  I will play the part as much as I can, but I don't think it is gonna be exactly what she needs.  Really it would help if her father would just stop being so pissed off and get out of a foul mood and talk to her.  Silly man.  Silly Wife.  Silly me.


We are gonna go to richmond for the 4th.  I need it.  I need to be around family, I feel like richmond is home, DC is a camp or something.  I have friends there that will love me even if I wrong them.  And real live full fledged family.  I want to move back -- however I like it up here.  I guess mostly for the training and the projects (like PDP) I can do up here.

Everett and Jason both have women.  this is a good thing.  I think Everet real has it for this girl, and Jason seems quite serious.  I think kelly would get along with them wonderfully.  However I do the know the night before we left Everett and his woman Sarah had a little spat -- and somehow got jason involved.  I hope that is blows over and thing are good when we go down this week.  I am desprate for avoiding a soap opera in richmond...

Ahh, back to work.
