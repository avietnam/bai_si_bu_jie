May 23, 2002

Long time no type.  Things are pretty much the same around here.  Work is kinda overwhelming, and I am responding by avoiding it.  That tends to make it more overwhelming  -- which results in me avoiding it more.  Everonce in a while I break down and do alot all at once.  If I would just break down and do it sooner it would be much less stressful.  Heh, go figure.  I gotta improve my work habbits/ethics. 

Coach Pei recently bought a new car.  A crazy new car.  A crazy expensive new car.  Yep, he got a Benz s600.  Them cars start around $115.8K.  That's more than alot of houses.  Insane.  So coach is being all sketchy and missing all these classes to go to meetings.  I think it is with Miss lily, mostly be cause Peter said that Coach Pei would not want his name mnetioned with hers.  Before that it was merely my and Alex speculating about it.  All I cna do is watch, sence none will talk to me about that stuff, because I am out of the loop and all.  Damn, I gotta learn to care about that less.


I guess I should get a kick out of Coach Zhang begging Melinie to bring Paulo in to fix the computers, but I just wish they would ask me to help.  Sigh.  Oh well. 

I think I am gonna teach chinese school next year.  My kids just seemed concerned at the thought of not having it, I broke down and have to return.  I really like them, even the annoying ones.  And some of them are really annoying.  Plus I talked to the principal about taking a chinese lantuage class in exchange for my teaching.  She seemed keen on the idea -- plus the class would run fomr 2-4, and my class starts at 4.  How great is that!

And after Chinese school, I cam back and we had Peter and Taiji Mike over to watch the simpsons.  Well, they went to see starwars at 6:30 -- so we taped it and were gonna watch it when they came over.  While I was moving the VCR downstairs KElly ordered pizza for us all.  Mike even insisted that he get a all veggie pizza.  Well, we hooked up the VCR and found out that we didnt get but the last 5 min of the simpsons.  After a few min of my trying ot entertain them with DVDs mike decided he wanted to leave.  Peter was his ride.  So peter being the uber polite person he is didnt say anything.  I was so pissed.  He insisted on his kinda pizza and then stuck us with them.  I even said he should wait for the pizza, but he said they would make good leftovers.  That bitch. I had been going otu of my way to see peter.  Kelly and I don't ever get to hang with him anymore.  About the only time I talk to him is online during the day.  At USWA he teaches the entire time -- from before I can show up till into my class (which he used to attend, but dosent because he teaches).  Back during the falling out I said to him that I was afraid of loosing him as a friend. He said non of the crap would make him not be my friend. I didnt mean that I thought he would get mad and un-friend me, but rather we would grow apart and never see each other.  That was my major concern for leaving USWA.  Paulo never shows up.  Melinie is pretty rare.  Even Keye, coaches new pet, is pretty scarce.  Philip only shows on friday with school and all -- I am having fewer and fewer reasons to stay.  At least coach Z is teaching me.  Damit.  it alwasy comes back to that.  I think abou tit way to much.  and in the paragraph I was suposed to just be raggin on Mike.  That Jerk.  Grrrr.


Looks like we are gonna be filming this weekend.  WE have everyone lined up and are gonna show at my place on saterday morning.  Weather Chanel is not calling for rain, we have all the players we need.  Disk is under way.

Here is the old script (this has and will change):

	DiskZG 

	Opens: 

	Establishing shot of apt building at night. 

	Upstairs in the loft surrounded by computer parts. 

	Hacker is on the phone. Hacker ejects the DVD and throw it into a jewel case. Hacker tells the person that he has it and will be right over. Runs down the stairs and out the door. 

	Out side he runs down the stairs and almost gets to his car. Two people pull up and he mumbles "they found me". A couple of guys dressed in black jump out of the other car. 

	Minion: Sir it appears you have something that belongs to us. 
	Hacker: (unlocking car door) I don't know what you are talking about. 
	Minion: give us the Disk, Sir. 


	Minion slams the partially open car door before Hacker can get into the car. Minion Grabs his arm, which Hacker twists pretty easily out of. A few quick grabs at the disk in his hands and Hacker Turns to run, another minion steps out from behind a car cutting him off. Hacker Stuffs the disk down his pants and try to make a run for it. Jumping over the next car. The minions catch up and after a quick skirmish knock him out. 

	Minion: Thug get the disk. 
	Thug: Dude, I aint going after that 
	Minion: Well Neither am I. 
	Thug: if we don't get that Disk Eisner is gonna be pissed 
	Minion: Then we take everything, you get the feet 

	The Minions throw Hacker in the trunk. You see the car drive off, a few moving shots of the car from another car and a few of it driving by on the streets. Cut to inside the trunk. Hear the car doors slam, and a gasp. Some rumbling around and kicking. With night vision we can see Hacker has his mouth duct taped shut. So the appropriate murmuring sounds. Outside the car you can see it shaking and year the yelling. 

	Voice over starts. 
	Narrator: Well I am gonna be in there till morning, so I guess I otta fill you in on how I got here. It started when Zero Gravity went big time, getting big money form the Hollywood types. Money was so big they couldn't see the term of the contract they signed. Those Hollywood types took control - None of them had any power to fight the Evil Eisner. They had no choice, acting against Eisner was suicide. They had to stop sharing their movies with everybody on the net, would charge large fees for people to come see private showings in expensive hotels. The rest of us indie action filmmakers had nothing. (cut to fake ZG message board, talking about how cool the new movie is, bitching about Eisner) I knew that they had a new short up on their server but could not share with the rest of us. So until I get a name with ZG on the end I can't play along. I decided to take things into my own hands. I would get that movie. (cut to scene of Hacker "hacking" onto the server -- fake FTP/ssh/script kiddie web page and all) It was pretty easy - Script Kiddies could have gotten in without scripts. (cut to disk burning, phone call and Hacker running out side) Well I burned that film and was heading out to a fellow tricksters house to watch it and practice some moves...You know what happened then. 

	Daytime shot of outside the car. The Minions come back talking on the phone... 

	Minion: Yes Sir, we have the disk, no, it's in my trunk. Of course Sir, we will bring it right over. Dude, go check on the disk 
	Thug: aighty 

	Thug walks over to the car and you see him get kicked in the face with both legs (shot from in front of the car - all you see is trunk lid and Thug getting kicked) 

	Hacker Jumps out, hands tied, tape over his mouth. Minion runs over and a quick skirmish with Hacker only using his legs and jumping over stuff. Minion helps Thug up and they go running after Hacker, who frees his hands on something that can cut duct tape. Rips the tape off his mouth and screams like it hurts. The minions hear that and come running. 

	Insert Good fight scene here! 

	Hacker swipes their car and heads off to a friends house. 

	Shot of Hacker knocking on the door, they do in and pop in the DVD, it plays, but it is DAMN. 

	Shot of Hacker and friend saying "Damn!"


Here is the message board conversation we were having about it:

	--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	OK, we need to work out some stuff for shooting Disk. 

	Mostly times and loactions. I will go through and story board the rest of the film this week. I kinda need to decide on a good urban loaction we can film at, where we won't have security guard problems and would look like it could be the outside of a evil hollywood corporation hit man hideout ... parking grage woudl be great but security would be a hastle. 

	When are you guys free? we need both the night shot and the day shot. the day one will prolly take 2 days. I think we can knock out the night in one couple-a-few hour session. 

	As far as choreo we will do it during filming. For this project I am pushing to keep it small but force the extra time and effort into quality. I can scan the storyboard and upload the script to the web page if you want it. 

	The ball is rolling don't let it stop

	--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Hey what fighting style should we do for the Disk? I don't think we should do wushu style because of the story of the movie. We should try more of an action type especially for the day shoot with 1 vs 2 people. I have some ideas about that. Let me know what you think.

	--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Think about the who am I roof scene. That is a similar flavor to what I intend disk to be. 

	with that tender sweet and sour chinese flavor vs. the two skilled thugs.

	--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	If the bad guys are going to wear black suits, we'll have to make sure we're not going to be rolling on the ground. Unless someone is paying for a budget of wardrobe, this is coming out of my working clothes closet. 

	Now that I think of it, I only dark gray suits.

	--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Actually, I really like the idea of either dark suits or long dark jackets. I guess we can get away with out using actual suits, but dark pants and a button down shirt and tie. We otta make a run to goodwill and pick stuff up there. I am certian we can find good thug clothes there. I just wanna make sure we fit the look we need for convincing hitmen. 

	Perhaps we can make a run this week? Thursday perhaps? Anyone know where goodwill or salvation army is? 

	I will be willing to pay for the clothes, no problem. It's my movie, I otta pay.

	I've got a charcoal gray lightweight trenchcoat I can wear. That should help out my image.

	--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Great! the trendh coats would fit right. do you have black/dark grey jeans or other tuff pants? Plus how much do you like that coat...I mean if you are gonna be rolling around on asphalt you prolly shouldnt be too attached. 

	I ahve a black trench coat, but I think I would rather see if I can find an alternitave because it is pretty nice. If we can't get suits for the thugs, we otta have them wear black pants and plain black shirts. however I like the idea of button down shirts -- kinda sells the part a bit more....

	Do you guys want to stop in a thrift shop on the way when we shoot? I think on sundays these shops might be closed. Definitely closed Monday. Do you still want to shoot on Saturday. We can try even if the weather is bad if we can find a covered parking garage....

	--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Alrighty, Looks like we are go for Saterday Morning. Weather Chanel is not calling for rain anymore on saterday or sunday. So I figure we can get this shot in those two days. That way we all still have monday free and this film stuff dosent "ruin" your entire weekend. 

	Lets plan on leaving my place 11 on saterday morning to go to the location. I know of a few places we can shoot at. One would be a school right down the street -- I will go scouting tonight when I go the the thrift stores/goodwill places for wardrobe. 

	I think my place is a good spot to meet because it is central to everyone and we all know how to get there. Speaking of everyone, that includes Me, Duanne, Dmitry, Beej and maybe Paulo. Paulo, you have to go help the Changs Haul stuff on saterday? 

	My current plan is to shoot the daytime during the day on saterday and sunday. If we are up for it then we can shoot the night sequence this weekend as well. It might be easier to shoot that during a weekday, but if we have the oppertunity to get it done -- lets do it. 

	Let me know if this is all cool or not. Lets get this movie done so someone else can make theirs (so I can get a break from being bossy). 

	Chris 

Needless to say I am quite excited about it.  We have added Duanne to the Peking Duck Group, and he is all up for doign artwork and filming.  I guess the fact that he is a former member of ZG helps.  Kinda reminds me of gerald.  Ok, reminds me alot of gerald.  Espically in the way he moves and acts.  Has a similar way of dodging criticism.  But that boy can draw.  He's amazing.  Dmitry is espically psyced that he is on our team now.  He was kinda the spark that got us on fire again.  I have recently redone the Peking Duck Site, added that messageboard, and revanped the entire look.  I guess most of that happend before duanne, but with his help we are really rolling along.

The best part is that Beej says he is gonna come out and and help film.  Gonna stick him on camera.  That is gonna help so much.
