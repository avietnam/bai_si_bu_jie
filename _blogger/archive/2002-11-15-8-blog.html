Ugh.  I have never had problems with alergys until I moved to VA, and I swear this year is by far the worst.  I guess it makes sence, they are saying that last week we had the higest pollen count in the washington area ever. So much flem.  I actually have been given a perscription to FloNase, you know a spray it up you nose type drug.  Kelly is getting me to take her Entex (which has been known to make me hyper) but I forgot to yesterday and today.  Actually I mostly remembered today -- the entex is sitting in a pile of other pills which I forgot to take this morning.  The other pills were my vitamins and whatnot.

The worst thing is when my nose runs I get this sore under it.  Lots of little blisters type sores right under my nose.  It is realy bad today.  Normally if I coat it with chapstick when I am blowing my nose I can help prevent it, but that did not work this time.  It's really embarassing, I am kinda avoiding my coworkers so they don't have to look at it.  Actually this time I have the sore on the inner edge of my right nostril -- instead of just on the upper lip that connects to the nose.  If I pop or scrape the blisters it will just scab up, and I think that takes even longer to heal -- however a scab is not quite as gross as a sore -- but may be more visiable.

Actually last saterday I went to the doctor for my foot.  He said I have tendonitius, and I went in kinda expecting them to say it was broken.  It is a really sharp pain on the blade (where the pinky toe bone has a joint) and according to him it is a insertion point for a tendon.  Very strange injury though.  There was never any swelling, and it only hurts after I have been moving for a few min, if I have been lying or sitting for a while I cna walk around for a min or two will little or no pain.  But when it kicks in it is an extremly sharp pain.  Not a big fan.


	
Oh, did I mention our trip to china was canceled?  Sucks like crazy.  We had to have 10 people to make the trip, but Glenn dropped out because Philip and Tom couldnt go.  Actually I was glad it got canceled.  I did not wanna go with out the guys going as well.  It would have sucked to be stuck with noone other than coach pei or suzie to talk to.  Maybe it would have helped repair things, but I kinda feel like that is not worth the effort to repair.  Plus I was ognly gonna be able to go for the second two weeks -- and the last week was not suposed to contain any real training, but be mostly trouristy stuff.  I could pretty much care less about that right now.  if I go I wanna go to train.  I need to get better and get my credentials better so I can teach later.  Hella annoying that the trip got canceled on my for the second year in a row.  I Am beginning to think I may want to find another way of going to china.   I know QDX said he would help me out, by hooking me up with friends or family of his over there -- so I may try to do that.  Perhaps I can tag along with another wushu school that goes to train.  Hey, if I do that I am sure I will make lots of new friends, that would be great fun.

This summer however I am determined to give kelly the vacation that she wants.  When I was still going to china she would get all worried that we were never going to go ona real vacation.  I admit I don't really care about them.  I mean, sure they would be fun, but they are expensive and get you nowhere.  I guess they are good stress releaf, but that is one of those things that I think you should be able to do on your own, in every day life.  I would much prefer to spend the money on otherthings -- the type of stuff that will get me where I want to be.  Either help me create or help my acheive my career goals.  You never heard of great things people have done by taking alot of cookie cutter corprate package vacations.  All of those type of things seem pretty silly for some reason. Worst thing is they are fake adventures.  You can't consider them as real adventures if everyone else in the country does it.  I would much more perfer something that you can tell a good story for (one of the criteria of an adventure) and have it push you a little to accomplish something.  

All that said, there is one aspect to them that is all improtant.  I want my wife to be happy.  If she wants to go to one of those things, then I will take her.  I never said they would not be fun -- and I will have fun if she wants use to go.  If it were just be I would not waste my money on it, but it is not just me.  And with the new factors in it, I don't consider it a waste of money.  I hope kelly understands how much I want to do the vacation thing for her.  And I know tha the is honestly upset and worried that we won't ever take real vacations. I mean, I plan on taking trips with her well into our old age, but I think I need to prove that we will take trips in the first place.  So I will do that, and she will be happy the entire time (if I have any say to it).

Time to go find neosporin and apply it to my nose.  stinking sore.
