Dang I am sore today.  After a week off being sick I have gone and gotten all sore.  I didn't even go to Wushu last night, it was just a little bit of gymnastics.  Last night was a thursday night, My coach Carlos lets me come in and drill some stuff while he has a private lesson.  He is really cool about it, won't even let me pay him for it.  I have been drilling nothing by round off back handprings.  I am sure I could throw a back tuck on at the end there, but I havent tried that yet.  I wanna be my back handsprings super consistant and solid.  

I found out that one of the guys form the power tumbling team is also trying out for Cirque.  He has already auditioned and made it to the final rounds before they told him to go away.  They later called him up to montreal to talk about some contract stuff -- he flew up there for a 15 min meeting, then the told him to go away.  Fun part is at the power tumbling world's he was approached by them a 3rd time.  So now he is debating going off and joing cirque (probably for the same show I am trying for) or waiting until after world's.  He is insane, national champion power tumbler.  Triple backs and alls sorts of triple twisting double backs and what not.  kid's got so much on me.  Hopefully they are looking for martial artist more.

I was reading little Alex's Blog recently.  I like that kid.  Too bad I never see him because of the fact he goes to USWA.  HE is getting good too.  Here is a little excerpt from his log:

<blockquote>	I was teaching Wushu today and in the next set of kids over, I saw this kid named Dennis. 15/ 16 years old doing his staff form. He was pretty damn fast, and thats when the thoughts hit me. I realized that he's faster than me or atleast soon will be. He's going to be better soon if I don't pick up. I had similar thoughts when I was pushing it in the advanced Wushu class when Andrew joined. It's not being number 2, its the feeling of being better and then slowly being overtaken. It's not like an upset victory because you see it coming.
	I can rationalize with things like I can jump higher and have better tricks, but when it comes down to it, I'm losing the edge.

	It is a shame that I never hit my peak and yet I am already deteriorating. I am tired of manning it out and waiting for a better tomorrow. I miss the days when I could just do it.

	Shame I know it's jealousy. Have you ever felt that you could have been better but missed it? The potential was there, but I missed it. I guess it goes for school too. I was always told that I was damn smart. If only I worked, I too could be applying for Harvard and have Ivy League dreams.

Funny thing is I have felt the exact same way he does -- about him.  I look at waht I am doing and it seems like I havent made any big advances in a LONG time.  I mean, I was doign roundoff back handsprings and butterfly twists back in college, and now I am still working those.  I knwo I have imporoved the quality of the stuff I can do but there are other things that I am scared of doing that I used to.  Like that frikkin wall flip.  

Well, with theis Cirque audition coming up I am gonna push so hard.  if I don't make any gains it won't be because I didn't try.  I am determined to get better.  I want to be competitive on a national level in wushu.  I have a ways to go, but I dont' think it is that far off.  I am tired of being good at the school level -- there are no regional levels for wushu, the next step is national.  

Stupid shin splints.  And my calf's are insane-o-sore.  hammies are stale twizlers -- changquan class day before yesterday did that.  However I had a good class -- coach lu said I had good tornados there.  So happy to hear that.

Kelly is feeling better, but not quite back up to speed.  She is takign the day off to go to waldorf to see her old dentist.  She has to get that crown replaced.  Not too much fun.  Poor girl, I wish she would get her voice back.
