<b>Quick Update!</b>
 Cirque got back to me:
<blockquote>
Dear Christopher, 

We could invite you in New York for a martiaL art audition in April (around the 12th).  Would it be more convenient for you?  I think that it would be awfull to cancell your terip to China. 

Please advise if April would be OK for you. 

Best regards 
</blockquote>
So much better.  Only possible conflict would be Elizabeth's Wedding that I am supposed to film on April 5th.  but that is not exactly "around" the 12th.  Still if I miss that it would be less then ideal, but much closer to the perfect audition than canceling China
