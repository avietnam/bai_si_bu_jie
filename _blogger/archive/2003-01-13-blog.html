Just finished lifting.  The new Cirque TV Show was on tonight.  I got to watch 3 episodes of it.  Too bad I had already seen 2 of them.  I get all excited about it, then i get all worried.  I keep playing out in my head how life will be when I get in and start training. Then I worry about not making it.  Then I think about doing wall backflips or round off - handspring - tuck's.  

this would compleatly change my life.  Put me years ahead of the conventional plan.  I would be rid of the cubicle for ever.  

Flip spin kick for a living.  By next year.  

It's like that time I drempt I had a new sterio.  It was so cool, the greatest sterio I could ever get.  When I woke up I didn't realize it was a dream.  i could not find it anywhere, and i looke every where.  My mom didn't know what I was talking about.  It struck me it was just a dream.  I hope I don't dream cirque.
