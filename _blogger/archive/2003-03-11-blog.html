Thought the morning was crappy?  It aint nothing.  I got called into my boss's office around 4:30 for a littile "We aint got no money" meeting.  fun stuff.  i basically got laid off.  Right now I have a few weeks of full time then we are going to part time until the cash runs out.  I just burned all my vacaion (and a decent amount of savings) on my trip, so I only got a few more days of that left.  Well I called my pimp (aka Kelly Daddy, who got me the job) to see if he can send any work this-a-way.  I feel like that "good for nothing" son-in-law that needs the hand outs from Daddy in order to support his daughter.  

Well, I guess things could be worse.  Oh wait, I am late for wushu (which is paid for this month) and a telemarketer just called -- so it is a little worse.  Did I mention that I got an email from Cirque?  it suks too -- it said they were postponing the audition for NYC for an indefinate amount of time.  I really hope I get the chance to acutally audition.  If I get the cirque gig all this headache will be forgotten in the blink of an eye.  Poof all better....I can dream.
