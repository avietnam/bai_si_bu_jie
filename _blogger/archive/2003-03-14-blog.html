The <a href=' http://fuzzymonk.homeip.net:8080/pdbb/ '>Peking Duck Message Board</a> is all but dead.  I go to China for less than a month and it all falls apart.  Stupid Communist government, why did they have to block my web page?

Well I just got out of a meeting on all the crappy things that will happen to me once I go part time here.  If they can't keep me above 30 hours a week life will suck.  On the plus side they had this meeting at lunch time so we get all afternoon to not wanna do anything at all.  Ugh, cranking out code is so much harder when you think 1) it's never gonna be used 2) you are not gonna be around to finish it anyway.  

I will just keep telling my self that if I work hard now that when the company gets more work they will like me more and give it to me.  

Hey! Stop laughing at me.
