I actually had a very good end of the week experience.  Well everything except for the dream I had on Friday night.  That spooked me.

But first the other stuff.  I am pretty sure that if you have read this log in the last few weeks you knew about the shoulder pains.  I have not been too happy with that whole situation.  Well, coach convinced me to go see her brother who is a Chinese doctor.  This Acupuncturist did a very detailed and thorough inspection ' moving my shoulder in every possible position, jabbing it with his thumb, pressing and twisting all the bones and muscles asking if I had any pain.  Which I didn't have (at least as a result of the poking and prodding), but I did realize how much more effort this guy went through than a western doctor would have for a similar injury.  Plus he actually attempted treatment.  Yes, that involved sticking needles in me.  In my shoulder to be exact.  The best part wasn't the actual sticking of the needles or the very hot UV lamp he put over my shoulder, but when he hooked the needles up to a power supply and ran electricity through them.  The Doctor kept asking me if I could tolerate it ' but he never turned it up past a strong twitch.  Hmmm, more of a tickle than twitch.  After lying on my side (in the dark listening to soothing music) for quite some time in a rather awkward position he sat me up and proceeded to thoroughly and mildly painfully massage my shoulder.  As far as I know that helped as much as the actual sticking of needles.  Maybe it was a combination of the two or some miraculous heeling from God that happen to kick in at the same time ' but I felt much better after that.  I went easy on my shoulder for the rest of the day, and the following day we did some filming but I only held the camera.  A few days earlier an hour or two of holding the camera would have caused plenty of pain but I felt at most mild discomfort.  Sunday I was able to teach my wushu class with no problems, whereas the week before I was hating any and all arm movements.  When you teach little kids and you show them a movement and you only use one arm they also only use one arm.  Doesn't matter if you tell them otherwise, they see you and copy that.

Gerald and Sean wound up crashing at my place all weekend, which was fun.  There were copious amounts of contact juggling and kung fu movies.
