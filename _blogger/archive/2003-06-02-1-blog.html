I just found out that Peter's wedding is this summer.  It's really depressing that I wasn't about to find about it until someone mentioned it on Raffi's message board.  And not even someone that knows Peter or even lives on this side for the country.  I miss hanging out with him - and I did try hard to get in touch with him but I couldn't ever get a response.  He used to be my best friend up in the area (and Kelly really loved him too), but politics appear to have ended that.  I am really happy for him and his woman, I really do want to see him do well.  It just sucks that I have not been able to be there at all.  I mean, who else has such a proactive interest in Wushu, PS2, Legos, Wushu, sci-fi books, Taiji, and Jet Li movies.  I still think about him on a regular basis and want to call, but I think I will only get depressed if I try.  Perhaps I will give it another shot, it would be worth it if I could see him again.

We have also gone a while with out seeing some of our other wushu friends.  Mostly Paulo, Mel, Greg and Glenn -- or those were they guys we would see on a pretty regular basis, but haven't in a while.  Not much point to harass them to get together when I really have very little free time as it is.  

Coach was up in Baltimore this entire weekend -- starting Thursday.  So we have all be slacking off in class.  Not that I didn't try to push hard, but with out the coach there you just don't tend to.  It's like human nature, you can't.  I have been working on staff, trying to get that in shape.  I think it is getting better, but I still need more explosion.
