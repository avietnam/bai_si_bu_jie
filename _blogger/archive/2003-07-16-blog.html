Wushu was pretty good.  I hit tornado split a good 4/5 times -- that screwup I just landed with my back leg too bent. Overall I was pretty happy with it.  No full set today, which I was hoping for.  Coach lectured us about sleeping/eating/warming up good in preperation for the tournament.

Ja Kai has a new XL-1.  Camera lust.  But I think my wife might (someday) buy me a camera like that.  If you consider the GL series \*like\* that. And I do.

Droped the jeep off at the dealer <b>again</b>.  4th time this month.  

I getta skip work and go to Kings Dominion tomorrow for a little team building fun time.  Yay!  So I am off to bed so i can get up early (why must forced-fun always start so crazy early?).  G'night.
