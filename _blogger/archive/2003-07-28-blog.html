I found this out on Xanga:<blockquote>DY got third in Long First, i believe, I don't think Christ from Omei got third.   I'm pretty sure Chris didn't get third.  </blockquote>
Thanks for the vote of confidence.  I really have something to prove still.  I feel like no matter what I do I will be plagued by the "goofy white guy" deduction.  Im not talkign about the judges, I mean the US wushu community.  

Fair or unfair, no one should stoop to unsportsman like conduct.  O-Mei bashing is in full effect, which really makes me sad.  I know everyone says they are not attacking the competitors, but the administration, but I personally feel attacked.  Not just for me, but for my friends too.  But like I said, nothing I can say about it that will have any effect, save for bad effect.

Considering going to Pittsburgh in 2 weeks, haveta decide soon if I want to go.
