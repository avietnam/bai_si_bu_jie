<b>Lunch #3, Monkey name Chris, 13th</b>

I have already eaten my lunch and I am still hungry.  I didn't even wait for lunchtime.  I donno if I am gonna just be hungry or go get some more food.  See, I have this problem when I get home I needa eat before wushu, but that doesn't give me more than an hour to get food and eat it.  So I wind up going to wushu just after eating.  Not happy times.  But it is also anti-happy when I am all shaky and shivery because I didn't eat. I need to move my eating times away from the traditional meal schedule.  I am thinking 10:30 for lunch #1 (I guess this could be breakfast, but I don't ever eat breakfast so I'll call it lunch), cause I am always hungry by then.  Then lunch #2 at 2:30 or 3.  And a post wushu dinner around 10.  That sounds more pleasant.  Maybe I will rename dinner to lunch #3, because that is way funner.  Heh. Funner. <a href="http://www.homestarrunner.com/sbemail68.html">Funnerlishious!</a>

This weekend was a lot of fun.  

We had a BBQ and forced a bunch of O-Mei people to come eat red meat (now, if we could only inter-mix our wushu friends), which was a success.  Except for Amina, who ate a veggie burger.  But we don't talk about that.  We hung out and played some games watched some wushu and learned the secrets of the shao lin.  In the process I got a monkey named after me.  So if you ever go to Brazil, make sure you find Paula and meet her monkey named "Chris."  Great stuff.  

Friday I went to bagua, but we didn't have a bagua coach so George took over and taught us a few new palms.  Now I know 1-7!  Only one more to go, then I have to worry about "perfecting" them.  Yay - modified dragon style. Saturday we did a lot of sub-sub-section drills.  Short little bits of the form -- more than a combo, but not quite half a section -- didn't get to spear, but s.s. needs work anyway.

Well, we did the math - I missed the US team by one hundredth of a point.  I finished 13th.  My goal was top twelve.  That was disappointing, but somewhat reassuring -- for some reason it makes me feel as if I am more accomplished than when swimply I didn't make the team.  Still, it's not enough.  I am not gonna settle.  Must train harder. Mmmm, bitter.
