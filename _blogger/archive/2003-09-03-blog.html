I used my guiding sword a little last night, because Stephan hasn't been able to replace his broken one yet, that sucka is heavy.  Wrist pain city.  I still may go back and use it a little because it is so heavy -- but aside form being slow and easy to hurt your self with, it feels solid.  Such a nice balance -- maybe I just need stronger wrists. 

Oh, I did wall flips last night.  Kelly said she was proud.  Yay me!

Actually, they were more like pole flips, and I didn't do any sans-spotter.  I was such a wuss in that regard.  I never crashed, I never <i>needed</i> a spot, but I just wanted the insurance there. I will get Carlos to spot me again next week and then I <b>have</b> to try on my own.  Even the one I messed up and rushed through turned out fine -- I made it to my feet.  Never came close to landing on my head or smacking the wall'so I needa go for it.  I also wanna learn how to spot like Carlos can, that guy is a crazy spotting machine.
