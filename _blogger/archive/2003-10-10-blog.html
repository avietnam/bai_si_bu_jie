<a href="http://www.4x4xplor.com/jks-qd.html">This Guy</a> suggests that you use a tie-rod end puller to remove the sway bar links.  Why didn't terraflex tell me that!  Also, the JKS quick discos look much nicer than the terraflex ones.  Maybe that would have been a better choice.  Oh, and I cannot forget to go purchase some Locktite.
