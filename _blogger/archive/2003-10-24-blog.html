Ok, so the coworkers think I am nuts.  But it drove me crazy to see the guy at McD's to throw away a Best Buy Buck.  I dug through the trash for a min or two screaming "come back dollar!"  but I never found it.  I stood there and watched (it happened in slow motion) as he threw it away.  I almost asked if he wanted that'but figured he would say yes for sure.  I mean, how can you not want a best buy buck?  Aiya!

I also decided I like football video games, so now I need trick the wife into wanting one too so I can have football fun with the video games.  And also also I hate the xbox controllers.  Does Microsoft think we have some sorta giant hands with little pencil-like finger tips?  Really.
