Wushu went surprisingly well last night.  Perhaps it's because Anita and An showed.  We had like 6 people there to help coach the 5 o'clock class, then I did the 6 (best part is nearly all those people who took taught the 5 came to the 6) and then we did the advanced class all nice: 15 min free warm up.  I then did 15 min of basics (fun stuff, no bo stance punch). 15 min of jumps.  A nice helping of sections and we toped it off with abs.  It worked really well with the crowd there (read: they were al advanced/mature enough to stick to that format).  

For my morning lifting I have decided to go back to the dead lift/press stuff I tried a while back at home, only now I have access to a full set of free weights.  I'll try the angry Russian program again and see how it works.  Today my weights were 225/205 dead lift and 135 press.  The press was light, but I was alone and haven't pressed a bar since McComas.
