I slept for a total of 18 hours last night.  Not exactly the most fun way to spend a friday night, but I think I was tired and needed the sleep.  So much for wushu.  I was out before 7 anyway.  

I must say I do like the feeling of waking up completely rested, even if it is combined with the lingering feeling that you haven't moved for a <b>very</b> long time.
