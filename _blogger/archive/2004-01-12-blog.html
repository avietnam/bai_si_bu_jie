As you can see I have acted on my paranoia.  Sorry, for making people login to see this, but in all honesty the people that really want to read this stuff already has an account on the pdp board. And hopefully this will weed out the people that may just stumble across things or are doing research on me and don't want me to know.  Sure, I could always just watch my logs, but that was hardly a deterrent.  So hopefully this project will get back on the right path, which was never supposed to be "this is what I did today" blogging.

Plus now I can use people's names, because in 15 years when I come back and read this I may not remember who 'J' was.
