Oh, I got a new wushu game.  No, I will not take credit for it, that credit goes to one of the kids in my Chinese school class.

It's alligator tag

Say you got a river with two banks and for some reason whenever the alligator yells 'go' you just gotta cross the river. Well, that's basically how this game works.  Set up the boundaries and declare someone it.  For the rest of the players the goal is to not get tagged.  However if you get tagged you must sit down where you were tagged ' and you become an alligator and can tag people that run by, but you are not allowed to move. 

Last man standing is the winner.  Well, the instructors and parents are also winners because it is cRaZy fun to watch.
