Traditional Wushu Team Trials, they are gonna be a day before Pan Am's, or so I hear.  I need 2 traditional forms, I am thinking chain whip and drunken bare hand.  Coach suggested Drunken Straight Sword, and Ditang, but I don't think that those would be the best for me to learn in such a short amount of time.  Anyway, Stephan is doing Drunken Sword, so we will need a different weapon for the demo team, so I might as well just stick to 9 section.

I ran through some 9 section whip basics tonight, including the fun butt hopping, which I didn't mess up on once.  Now I just got to figure out a few more trick and cram them together into a form.  Drunken is not so easy
