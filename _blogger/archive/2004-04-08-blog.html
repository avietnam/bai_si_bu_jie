I am sore (specifically my left calf and left butt cheek).  I have been training a lot recently, and while I am supposed to compete this weekend I haven't been working on anything that I will actually do at the competition.  Last night I actually trained compulsory, and in the morning it was drunken.  

I went with Jonathan to the morning training along with Chad and Stephan.  It was good hard training -- plus with the night before consisting of sword class chased by gymnastics I had not fully recovered before I showed up.  Strange thing, I totally crashed a butterfly.  Well, I was doing the second of two and I somehow did a twist.  I didn't want to twist, but I did.  I crashed it politely (I do remember seeing the ceiling in the middle, and thinking 'Oh crap, the ceiling').  After that I was having a serious complex and couldn't do a butterfly with out the crazy feeling that I was rotating.  It freaked me out.  It still freaks me out.  I don't know what made me do that, and it has happened before when I train a lot of twists and try to go back to regular butterflies. I own butterflies.  That is my trick.  Dammit!

I think part of the problem was the fact that I had another freak 'loss of skill that I normally own,' in class earlier this week (Monday I think) we were just jumping up and doing a 'standing jump outside jump' a.k.a. jump and spin.  Normally I have no problem with a 720.  I couldn't do a 360 with out leaning.  It was freakish.  It was disturbing.  I didn't like it.  I tried again yesterday it my jump-n-spin seemed to be back to normal.   However I seem to have this sinking feeling like that skill is gone.  It's scary.

Now I have to try to concentrate on this tournament AND deal with freaky skill loss.  Zao gao le!
