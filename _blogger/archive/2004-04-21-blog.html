So  I grab my laptop and drag it over to the new house.  Guess what happens when I turn it on, yep, I got a wireless connection.  Good ole linksys, jsut leaving it's ass hanging out in the open like that.  

Hmm, maybe I should cancel that DSL order that I have been waiting on.  Verizon has given me the run around a couple of times on the phone when I call up and ask technical Questions.

Mooching off of the neibours before I even meet them is fun.  

It's late.  It's the first night in my house.  My wife is in richmond. 

D, D, J and S:  Thanks for all the help.  

 I havn't trained in a week - I don't miss it (least not yet).  I miss sleeping however.  G'Night.
