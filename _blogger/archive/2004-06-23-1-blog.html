I finally saw last action star last night.  No wushu in it this time, it was all drama acting and a make-over.  Last week when people were telling me how they were training with Eric Chen and all the wushu fun I was really regretting not sending in my demo video.  After watching the show last night I am <b>really</b> glad I didn't.  It was a bunch of uber-vain super-cool pretty people.  While I may be vain, and even have veins, I am not nearly cool or pretty enough for all that.  I would have loved that stunt work, and even the acting drills but this other stuff, all the <i>MTV Real World</i> schisms and bickering really doesn't seem like anything worth while.  Not that I could have gotten that far, due to my personal levels of coolness and prettiness. 

Yesterday we did good.  At least Chad and I (Stephan== slacker), we hit up lifting in the morning, wushu and gymnastics that night.  I admit it was pretty slack, I didn't do dead lifts in the morning and I trained jiu jie bian at wushu.  Even gymnastics should have been harder, but I was pretty happy.  The only thing I left out was more tumbling.  I <b>need</b> to be drilling the stuff I already know, especially the things like tumbling that I won't practice anywhere else.

Scariest dream ever:  running from a evil version of yourself.   Only I could climb walls, and had some sorta double jointed jaw with extra longer, sharper, insect like teeth.
