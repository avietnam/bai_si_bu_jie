I did not want to lift today.  But we did.  Stephan and Chad even joked on me that I was late.  It was in my house.  They beat me to the basement.  I was ashamed, as I should be.

Maybe it was because we started plyometrics last night. I may not be ready for that stuff yet.  Serious consideration on putting it off for a wile, any jumping I do will not be sport specific, but the actual sport.  Just wushu jumps. Frog jumps, split-leg jumps, no-arm jumps, etc can wait for a while.  Not sure, the guys might talk me into doing them again, but I think strength conditioning and regular wushu training is what I need for now.

I also need an optional sword.  And more spear practice.  I suck at spear.
