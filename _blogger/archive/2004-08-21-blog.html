I didn't realize how much I really miss everyone.  I got real nostalgic, and wanted the good old days again. I wanted to go back to I could hang out with everyone again.  I saw people who were once so close just give me that polite-to-strangers feel.  It's depressing.  I feel like if I were to go back it would be like it was.  But I know it won't. It can't.  Aiya.  

(At this point someone slaps me across my face and I snap out if it)

Seeing them all again was so nice, hanging out, talking about doing stuff ' we were talking about making a movie again.  One last film before something drastic happens like people moving to LA.
