Bursitis. In my heel.  Sonofabitch.



WebMD says:<blockquote> Bursitis is inflammation of a bursa, a small sac of fluid that cushions and lubricates an area between tendon and bone or around a joint. The inflammation can cause the bursa to swell with fluid. Bursitis can occur anywhere in the body where there is a bursa, usually near a joint. The condition is often painful. <a href="http://my.webmd.com/hw/health_guide_atoz/tn3727.asp?lastselectedguid={5FE84E90-BC77-4056-A91C-9531713CA348}" border="0"><img src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/blog/image/595/bursa.jpg" class="center" /></a></blockquote>But anything that doesn't irritate it is A-OK according to the Doc.  Dr. Miliani is my favorite wahoo.  Him and Tom, but only because Tom called me and wants me to pull a basketball hoop out of the ground with my jeep.  And that sounds like it will be as much fun as cutting up a swing set with a chainsaw.
