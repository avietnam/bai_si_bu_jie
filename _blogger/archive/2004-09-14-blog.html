We can't go to the picnic.  Those selfish condescending lil _____.  I just want to play volleyball and have a hotdog with everyone else.

Tonight is going to be an interesting mix of juggling cars, wushu, gymnastics and going home to get stuff for the cars, wushu and gymnastics.  I havn't been to the gym since the beginning of summer, and I can't go next week, so I really otta make a point of doing some flipping tonight, but it is not really convenient.  Getting up early, going to woodbridge, finding a way home sans car.  I am gonna be tired tonight.  Don't expect to be home till after 11.

I even ditched wushu and watched 4 episodes of stargate.  I am ashamed.   My real excuse is physical injuries, primarily my inability to look left.  Yes, I tried to do kip ups before I was warmed up, pulled something in my neck.  Now I am a unilooker.

Chipotle time.  


<i>Update:  We coulda gone, and we coulda played, but we didn't buy tickets.  Woulda cut in on our cash for other less fun activities.  Bah.</i>
