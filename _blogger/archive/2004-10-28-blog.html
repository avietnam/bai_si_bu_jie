I have a groin.  Not like that, the <i>bad</i> kind.  Like our #9 midget with a groin.  The tornado kicks were so much better with the one leg set.  But that apperently stresses my hip abductor alot.  Even jump outsides were hurty.

Costume ideas, as much as I want to be the Poopsmith as M-Bison, I think I can't pull that off.  Strongsad's left leg is a good one anyway.  Yes it had to be HSR related, yes, I know very few people will get it.  It is totally worth it for those few people.  The only good non-HST idea this year has been Keith Stack from Milborne NJ, and Danny has that.  Well, a jellyfish that could actually sting people wasn't too shabby. 

In other news a chinese dictionary...<a href="/chinese/search.php">phpCEDICT</a>.  Yay.  

And we banged pots and pans at the lunar eclipse--well, at the dragon that ate the moon.  I also shook a black cat at it, 'cause them thngs are scary.

Bla bla blabbity bla.
