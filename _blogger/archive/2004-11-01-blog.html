ho\*ki do (ho'ge doe)



Hokido translates to the Way of the Tiger Energy or the Way of the Tiger Spirit. However if you pronounce it incorrectly is can easily be thought of as "The way of the Tiger Kids." All these definitions are acceptable to the founders. Unfortunately for the reputation of the art we are the founders. Let me give you the story of how this art came about.



A group of Martial artists from Virginia Tech, all of whom had either black belts in Tae Kwon Do or the equivalent in a sister art, attended the VT Tae Kwon Do club. This club took a trip down to a big tournament in Raleigh NC. It was at this very tournament that we all attended a lecture from the granddaddy of Tae Kwon Do -- General Choi. Choi went on the explain who he was and why he has sole rights to the Art of Tae Kwon Do. He explained how he founded it and if you are not doing exactly what he is doing you are doing karate. Someone even asked about Kungfu, he said that was karate. At this point he went on to explain his new Sine wave theory and using arguments that are not founded by any mathematical or scientific means (we are all engineers, BTW). Making all of his once adoring fans become confused and frustrated. We were so excited that we were going to hear the founder of the art speak, only to be seared with his condescending sermon. I am not trying to undermine this man, nor claim is art is poo, I am simply explaining the impression he had on us. I am sorry if I have offended you.



At this point we knew if we did not abide by every thing he had said, that we would not be studying "Tae Kwon Do." So we decided that we were now studying hokie-do. (Virginia Tech Hokie's) This was initially a joke. We all laughed, but after time Gerald and I continued to claim to practice Hokie-do. Starting with Our Tae Kwon Do knowledge we applied Jeet Kune Do concepts while force feeding acrobatics into it. Making Hokido a labeled version of everything we do. Much like Bruce Lee invented Jeet Kune Do (please -- don't get me wrong, I am not comparing us to him, that would be an insult to him, rather I am giving credit for the borrowed ideas), and said that take what works for you, well we did. But unlike Jeet Kune do, we are not purely concerned with fighting arts, Hokido also contains performing arts. Acrobatics and Gymnastics are just as much a part of Hokido as sparring and ground fighting.



We speak lightly of the label "Hokido," but think of it as a goal for our personal refinement.



Wow, you made it this far -- I am impressed.

Chris.
