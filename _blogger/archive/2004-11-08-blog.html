Finally go back and am settled in.  We have been gone almost an entire week.  Last minute plane tickets to Texas, for Kelly's grandmother's funeral.  It was a pretty sad and tiring trip. The plus side is we did get to go see my Nana, Aunt Claudia  and G'pa Jim. The pluses also included Kelly's Uncle Bill and Aunt Diana, who's couch Kelly viciously broke.  Rendering the hide-a-bed unusable.  So we went to sleep that night on an air mattress and awoke (early) the next morning on a vinyl mat. 



While it was good to see family, and I am glad Kelly got to make the rounds with hers, we need to go back and mess with Texas under better circumstances. 



The flight back to DCA got in around midnight, so we got our car out of hoc and went home.  Kelly was absolutely exhausted.  The next morning we woke up, unpacked, repacked and hopped in the car and headed to Richmond.  We listened to the VT game on the radio on the way to Sara (formerly) Kretzer's wedding, and were even responsible to giving updates to the Kretzer family though out the reception.  Hooray for WAP.  When the Hokies won, Mr. K made a run for the microphone and announced it to everyone. The wedding was nice, and they had the reception right there at Grove.  Highlights of the reception included a chocolate fountain, Senior Hedrick and Brady Ojibway calling me Everett.

I got dinner with Everett, while Kelly napped and we all headed to the Ojibway's house for a bonfire.  I am impressed that we didn't burn down A) the woods and B) the power lines.  I'll have to call Jason and see if his brother ever went to the hospital for jumping over the fire.  They were just warming to up the jumpin' when we left.

And now a gratuitous picture of a cat:
