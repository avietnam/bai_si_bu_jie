OK, I am gonna make a <i>Krav\*\*</i> Mix CD, and I want a proper full 80 minuite CD.  Full hard rock pumped-for-fighting stuff.  I so I did what I should and consulted Neal.  Here is the working list so far:

 * Dead Cell and Blood Brothers, both by Papa Roach
 * Awake and I Stand Alone, both Godsmack
 * My Hero, Foo Fighters
 * Defy You, Offspring
 * Paint it Black, Earth Crisis (cover)
 * Fuel, Metallica
 * Immortal, Adema
 * Points of Authority, Linkin Park
 * Taste the Red Hands, Dead Poetic
 * Whisper, Evanescence
 * Nice Guys Finish Last, Green Day
 * Motorbreath, Metallica
 * Down With The Sickness, Disturbed
 * Fight Fire with Fire, Met.
 * Still Waiting, Sum 41

\*\*According to Sean they rock the hard core stuff while training hard core at Krav, so thus it is <i>krav</i> music.
