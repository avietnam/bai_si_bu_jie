Wushu friday night was pretty good.  Then we trained for the demo on saturday, everything was gong well.  I got through all the hard training and we switched to weapons.  Since we had a demo that night I did 9 section, so everythign was a peice of cake.  I went the first time with some suckiness, so I asked coach if I could go again at the end, and when I was done my right calf was hurting.  Sounds like what I had <a href="http://www.fuzzymonk.com/chris/log/2005/02/mysterious-calf-injury.php">before</a>. Big bad ballet calf.  It does not seem as bad, but I am gonna be real nice to it for a while and see how it goes.  

In other news game night was fun and the wife has been bronzed. In some neat streaks and spots.
