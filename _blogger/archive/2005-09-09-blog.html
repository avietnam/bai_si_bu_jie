is 8,006,008,977.

I love the direct line to the costumer retention department.  I called and chatted with Aaron for a wile, we talked aobut football, scifi, nascar, college and computers for a wile and he hooked me up with a sweet deal. I understand that I prolly could have gotten some more out of him, but I figure the $299 (minus the $100 rebate) for the HR10-250 was a good deal.  Beej was happy with his $699 and a $200 credit at directv.  When I told him about my deal he didn't beleave me.

beej: 299 HD Tivo? 
me: correct
beej: i cant believe it

All said and done it is $199 (+tax, stupid the man).  Bully!
