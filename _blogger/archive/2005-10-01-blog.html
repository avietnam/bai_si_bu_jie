It has been awhile, and I haven’t posted because I have been super busy.  Since I have been busy a lot of (fun) things have happened.  With my continued busyness I don’t thin I will be able to assert the required effort to describe them.  Perhaps I can revisit them soon, but until then here is the high level overview.  Tivo style.

Badoop-badoop-badoop...

Went to Radford to see my lil’ist sister.  The excuse for the trip was the Football game. Ohio was shut out 45-0.  We took Jessica along.  She didn’t have any VT apparel.  Shameful.

I officially left my company.  I also officially got sick from drinking.  I blame Tom and to a lesser extent Ben.  Oh, and Ryan, Riya and Dave too.  Not Kelly.  Never blame Kelly if you want her to take care of you.  Kelly took care of me.

I trained Saturday with little pain, but it was a light workout as the kids had demo practice so it was just me and Jason with a few beginners.  After training I promptly ran to Springfield mall to try and find Kelly a present.  I wanted to get a nice silver bracelet.  That was harder than I thought.  I wound up picking up a gold hearts one.  

Badoop-badoop...

We spent some fun time with the Tulli, had a little BBQ and celebrated Kelly and her dad’s birthdays.  We got him XM, and instead of paying best buy install it for us I opted to pocket the $40 and plug the thing into the cigarette lighter my self.  Seriously, that and run the antenna was the entire install. $40, my…

I also jammed my right middle finger something awful.  After we were done playing catch. We were walking in and Neal tossed the football to me and \*crack\* time for ice.  That has made sword especially difficult.

Kelly’s official birthday was Monday.  So I had to do something fun.  She had a left over gift certificate for the Ritz which we cashed in for Sunday night.  Even ate a wonderful dinner at Cheesecake factory.  Well, over ate. 

Most of Monday was spent downtown at the national archives.  I saw the constitution.  

Gong! 

SONOFABITCH! Someone hacked my website and busted up phpBB, so some thing may be down for a bit.
