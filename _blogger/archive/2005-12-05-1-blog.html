Well, I have decided to make my blog public again.  I don't know if it is a permanent thing or not.  I may reinstitute a password again once I figure out a system that is not based on phpbb.  Now that I work for a nice company I also feel a little more comfortable having an open blog again.  Not that my last company was un-nice, they were just corporate-ified.
