I'll see everyone at Lamaze.  Don't worry we have a blanket and two pillows in the car.

I like podcasts.  The only problem is sifting through the crappy ones, but then you find something fun like the awesome giants one or the hyper active podrunner.  However I won't admit to listening to the MacCast one.  That would just be too much.

Oh, and <a href=" http://www.redbullflugtagusa.com/">this</a> is my idea of fun.  However I was told to be discrete so I won't go into detail.

In closing I will leave you with a picture of our lake.  I went with Kelly on one of her walks around the lake.  Besides slowing her down and making it a less viable means of exercise I was able experiment with the camera.
