In the car ride into work this morning I was talking to kelly.  Here is a breif exerpt of our conversation:

Me: Kelly, are you a weeble-wobble?
Her: No, I fall down.
Me: So your a weeble-thud?
Her: Yes.

I have conversations like this all the time, yet Kelly is still nice to me.  I have no clue why.  But we did decide if we need to get weeble-wobbles for Leah we can just talk to Aimee.

Oh, and from Jiayo:

"U.S.A is great also. Especially when Stephon Morton and Chris Sexton is representing." --batman

Clearly the Dark Knight dosen't know what he is talking about, but it sure made my day.
