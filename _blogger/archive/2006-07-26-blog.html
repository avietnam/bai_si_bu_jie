I am back home, and back with my women.  I returned home to find them in good shape, and happy to see me.  I need to readjust to the sleep schedule, which the after party and all the traveling threw way out of whack.  Baby girl seems to have a supernatural ability to wake up when we set her down in the bassinette.  

Let me give a quick pan am update.  The tournament went really well.  I had the public goal of bringing home a medal, and I brought home two.  Secretly I really wanted to get gold, I tried to convince myself that any medal would do, but I couldn't do it.  I wanted a gold--I feel egotistical admitting it, but it is true. I figured I had one chance and that was in jianshu, but I wound up with a silver (which was bittersweet as there was a tie for gold, making me 3rd in the event).  Qiang was the only event left, my worst event.  I tried to convince Stephon to come to duilan but no luck, so I decided I was happy with my medal and I would try to have as much fun as possible in spear. By the time I went there was a 3 way tie for gold everyone at 9.3.  So while I was waiting for my score I was hoping for a 9.3, figuring it would be a stretch.  Then it popped up, 9.4. All I could think was "no way."   You would think I would be really relieved at that, but I didn't believe it--it still hasn't sunk in.  Needless to say I was really happy, even with out duilan (which was supposed to be my best shot).  

While I had high hopes for jianshu my form was not my best.  I had two big brain farts. The biggest one was in section three where I stood up facing the wrong direction.  I just stood there, wondering who turned the room around and how I was going to fix things and go in the right direction.  My internal monologue was quite active at the time, involving many less-than-polite words.  The other big things was the second to last movement, I did something, realized that wasn't in my form, was at a loss with what to do next so I did it again.  My teammates said they didnâ€™t notice the mistakes, but stuff like that throws you off and the rest of the form is defiantly not going to be as good as it could. Luckily I didn't drop my weapon on any of the tosses or any of the other nightmare situations I had dreamt up while preparing. 

Changquan was pretty normal except for a bobble on my tornado.  ZFJ360, c'mon!  A bobble on a 360, really?  Oh well.  In the end I did well enough to get a certificate. Sure, Colvin beat me, but he was on fire.  I was very happy with the results, but not quite pleased with my performance. 

While I was there I didn't have very much down time, but when I did I spent most of it thinking about the women back home.  I had a good time seeing old friends and telling them the good news, and like any other proud dad I was showing off pictures.  Part of the reason I had little down time was due to the fact that I was appointed as team captain  Sure it sounds cool, but in reality  it is just a bunch of responsibility I didn't ask for.  I guess in the end most of the stuff is stuff I would have done anyway, but now I had to do it.

Now I am at work and must make up for lost time.
