I spent all day thinking it was Thursday.  It is not.  It is Wednesday. 

This is actually a good thing, because I have been in a panic all day trying to get stuff done for the big project. But because of this I am in a little situation.  I made a big deal about how I wasn't going to be in the office tomorrow, ordering people around and pushing for extra help all day today.  Now tomorrow I will get "aren't you supposed to be on a plane" from everyone.  I feel so smrt.

I feel as if I have a few options

A) Stay home
B) Act like they are the crazy ones
C) Do lots of back tucks and aerials so they talk about that instead

Lets go with A.
