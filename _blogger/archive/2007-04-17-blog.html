This tragedy really hits closer to home than I would have expected.  Kelly and I were talking about why it hits so hard.  I mean, we don't have any tangeable reason to feel so affected. But as Kelly pointed out to me Tech is how we have defined our selves for our entire adult lives. That is where we met, that is where we grew up.  Our prayers for the family's of those who were hurt, and the entire Hokie nation.
