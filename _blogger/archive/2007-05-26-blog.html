Today Leah, Kelly and I were in the kitchen playin' magnets and doing some dishes.  Leah toddles over to the dishwasher in her normal baby like way and starts licking it.  She turns around and says a few baby-gibberish things to Kelly who simply assumes that the little girl was trying to persuade her to join in the dishwasher licking. So my brilliant wife says "okay!" scoots over and licks the dishwasher too.

I just though that needed be said.
