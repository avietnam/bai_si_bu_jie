I've been doing a bunch of interviews for programmers these days. I have been elected the phone screen guy, so whenever we get a new resume from the recruiter I get to give them a call to see if they are worth bringing in.  Alot of them are not.

I have made a few rules for interviews.  If any of these rules are broken, I promptly thank them for their time and get off the phone, otherwise I would simply be getting their hopes up.

Rule 1: Do not beg.

I don't care how much you want the job, begging don't help. Especially if you are under-qualified for the position. 

Rule 2: Answer the question asked.

Seriously, I like when people say "I don't know," if you ramble off in an unrelated direction, I just get annoyed.

I am going to start writing down quotes.  Here is a quick excerpt from a recent phone call:

Me: What is the difference between recursion and iteration?
Them: Oh, well, recursion, yeah I had a project that really needed that and I was going to implement it last year, but I didn't get a chance to. 

Later in that call:

Me: Can you name a few design patterns?
Them: Um, sure.  Creator .... Polymorphism .... Protected.

I am sure there are plenty of rules where those came from.
