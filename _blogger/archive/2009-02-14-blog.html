I lost my keys. I really couldn't find them.  I looked everywhere they could be, everywhere that is within reach of a two and a half year old. The really crappy part is they have my hard token on them.  I did not want to call IT and have to get a new one, with "director level" approval. Ugh. 

Retraced my steps.  Last time I saw them was when I had Kelly read me the secret numbers so I could send an email.  On a side note: sending email takes way too much effort. I remember that she did this very clearly because she read the numbers upside down to start with. She claims that she then physically handed me the keys. But I firmly but disagreed.  Oh, another side note: don't disagree with your wife when it just doesn't matter. 

After going through the desk and my bag, we both agreed that little miss must have taken them.  I seem to remember the 'fixing' of my tower with keys. And I think that occurred after the upside down number incident. 

We pulled up the couch. Went through the fridge and cabinets. Litter box. Trash cans. Toy boxes. 

Nothing.

I was in the kitchen going through the shoe pile when kelly announce that she 'though she just heard them.'  Understanding that left to their own devices my keys do not make any sound I could only figure she was mocking me in some way.  But nope, she had ninja like hearing and heard a little jingle when standing up from our desk chair.

Well that desk chair is a fancy feux Areon from Office Max, and happens to have an elabrate truss system for the lumbar support, that, from the point of view of a two year old, makes a hand place to store some fixin' keys.

Had Kelly not heard them I don't think I would have found them until the next time I disasemmebled my office chair. And I don't know about you, but I don't disassemble my office chair very often at all. Maybe I should start, who knows what I might find.
