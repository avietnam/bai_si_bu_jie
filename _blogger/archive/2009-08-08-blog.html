Kelly took Leah to the grocery store to get us dinner and I jumped at the oppertunity. It was time to give that boy a haircut. I knew the risk I was taking, but I wasn't going to chance people starting to think his pretty curls meant he was a girl. So I busted out the clippers.

Handsome and cute. Dad wins!

When Kelly got home she said he looked like his dad. Then started crying.

The good news is I am unharmed, however she knows where I sleep.  I may wake up bald.
