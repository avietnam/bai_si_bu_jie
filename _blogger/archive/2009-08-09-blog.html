<div>Leah kept asking for candy, I assume it is because she found the bowl of M&amp;Ms I stuck on the top shelf of the desk. But I didn't cave right away.</div><div>
</div>I told Leah that she could have two, count 'em, two pieces of candy if she was good for her bath. She asked if they could be green candies, and I agreed.<div>
</div><div>We then went up for baths, and she did great. Even during the de-tangling of her hair. Her mom tagged me out about 1/2 way though. When they were  done they cam back downstairs and she asked if she could watch a movie. I said no, but we could play a game. She picked out candy land and Kelly reminded her that she also got to have candy. So I went and grabbed both the green M&amp;Ms and set them next to the candy land board. </div><div>
</div><div>She smiled and said "thank you." Then she handed one to me and said "we can share, this one is for you."</div><div>
</div><div>At this point I died. Yep. I must be a zombie now.</div><div>
</div><div>Seriously. How can you get a 3 year old to share HALF of her candy? Especially when all her candy consisted of a whopping 2 M&amp;Ms.</div><div>

Story time, shortly after candy land. Did I mention I won this time? It was a first.</div>
