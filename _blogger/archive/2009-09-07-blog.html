Seems like all the little girls Leah's age want to be princesses. Leah has decided she like ballerinas better, and considering how this is a more noble cause (pun intended) -- ballet requires hard work, determination and flexibility (all things required for wushu, btw), I am encouraging it.

So in my recent trip to San Diego I bought her ballerina paper dolls. At a great <a href="http://www.hillsideartisans.com/">little shop</a>.  She loves them, so much that I played too. Yeah, I said it.

Jorge, tell Karen she needs to open a shop in Northern Virginia. She would make a KILLING.

Hillside Artisans was teh awesome, I don't think there was a single thing in the store that my wife would not like. And lets face it, when buying stuff for the kids the goal is to make the wife happy.
