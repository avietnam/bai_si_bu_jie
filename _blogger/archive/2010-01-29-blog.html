Just picked up Leah and Lars and I was headed home. I popped in a CD with their music and the following conversation ensued:

<b>Leah</b>: Is this Imagination Movers?
<b>Me</b>: Yes it is.
<b>Leah</b>: I like Imaganation Movers, can we listen to it loud?
<i>\*turns up radio\*</i>
<b>Me</b>: ARE YOU ROCKING OUT?"
<b>Leah</b>: WHAT YOU SAY? WHAT?
<i>\*turns down radio\*</i>
<b>Me</b>: When you want to ask someone what they said you should say "Can you please tell me what you said?"
<b>Leah</b>: I SAID WHAT!
<b>Me</b>: No, when you ask someone that you should say "Can you tell me what you said, please?"
<b>Leah</b>: I SAID WHAT!
<b>Me</b>: YOU need to say "Can you tell me what you said, please?"
<b>Leah</b>: I SAID WHAT!
<i>\*turns up radio\*</i>
