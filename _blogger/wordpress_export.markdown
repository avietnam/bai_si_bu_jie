<content:encoded><![CDATA[7/11/2002

I was just surfing the web again (at work!  *gasp*) and was looking at the stuff on USWA's website.  Actually I was there to trying to find my comptition results history.  Just so I don't forget here are my results:

Yin Yang 2001
Advanced Men Chang Quan  9.8 -- Silver
Advanced Men Long 9.82 (tied for silver w/ Jason) -- Bronze
Advanced Men Short 9.6

Li Jing Heng 2001
Gold Intermediate Short Weapon
Gold Intermediate Long Weapon

I remember writing those articles for the webpage, I don't want them to go away (and they just might, because I wrote them) so I am gonna include them here.  Too bad I can't put pictures in here.  There is a great one at Yin Yang of me and kelly showing off out bicepts.  She is so cute.

Anyway here they are:

 Wushu shoot out in Ft. Meade. (Yin Yang 2001)

 Earlier than most usually leave for work, around 7:30, a number of USWA people were on the road to Ft. Meade Middle school in Maryland. A new tournament, only in it's second year had a nice showing of contemporary wushu and taiji. Traditionally this tournament was a traditional event, being run by a traditionally traditional school, Dahle Kung Fu. The event was opened up with a moving America the beautiful trumpet solo followed by an energetic lion dance. After the opening demos the competition was quickly called into motion, running smoothly with little wait for the competitors. From what I understand the Taiji ring ran a little slow, but, really, what can you expect?

 The wushu competition was higher than expected from such a traditional event, every one had to get out there and work for their score. The wushu ring was run under the guidance of head judge Ji Yin Er, direct from china. She kept things running smoothly and quickly, the only delay was when they took a break for lunch, which gave us competitors a great chance to warm up and review our routines. Things were kept rolling through to the end, and when the scores were totaled up Ted Fu, with his clean southern styling came out on top with the Wushu Grand Champion.

 The taiji competition showed off a wide variety of styles and interpretations, both from beginners and veterans alike. Yang, Wu, and Chen Taiji events were followed by Xing Yi and Ba Gua forms, with many of the competitors demostrating their skill in multiple styles. To accomodate the diversity of interpretations present, the competitors were told judging was to be based on the principles of Taiji as expressed by the Taiji Classics. While the Taiji judges were very conservative in handing out high scores when compared to the Wushu judges, it was a good reminder to us all that we will never truly master the art of Taiji, but rather we should aspire to constantly refine ourselves.

And the other one:

 Battle Amongst the Palm Trees

 Phoenix AZ. It's cooled off to 105 degrees, the mountains in the back ground seem to giggle as the hot air rises from the ground, the smell of feivues melting to the asphalt. Yep, it's Li Jing Heng's Grand Championship and Festival again. The seminars began on Thursday, Aug 30, and the competitions the following Saturday. Masters from all over the world taught at the seminars, from Kenny Perez to Qiu Dong Xing. The real excitement started on Friday night at the first masters demo, the most noticeable were Li Jing and Qiu Dong Xing. Li Jing's straight sword was mesmerizing as she floated across the stage in the most graceful demonstration of power. Qiu Dong Xing's explosive broadsword demanded everybody's attention.

 The next morning the tournament room was still buzzing with the left over energy from the night before. Wushu competitor formed a line practicing their jumps while a dozen Taiji competitors gracefully warmed up in their little square. As a local TV station ran around filming the warms ups as a few of the younger (and not so young) athletes tried to show their big tricks for the home audience. Then over the PA came the voice of MC Christopher Pei, calling the judges to their rings. The large ring in the center of the room featured modern wushu, while Taiji was neatly placed off in a far corner, trapped behind the Hard Style Forms Ring. There was also a noticeable showing form the Traditional Kung Fu people.

 Silks were straightened and everyone lined up. As each division was called, wushu competitors switched from weapon to weapon (and sometime no weapon), ran out and gave us a minute and twenty seconds of excitement. The advanced division were great -- from the Haight Sisters to Eddy "the flying eagle" Quintana. Believe it or not, Eddie did an eagle form in the optional empty hand routines. If fact the optional routines were nicely diverse, David Chang's super clean Mantis, Jerry Taing's great drunken, Jennifer Haight's impressive Fanzi.

 The Saturday Night Masters Demo was excellent, setting the mood was a Phoenix area Kodo Drummer team, whose tribal sounds got everyone ready to see some good martial arts. Like Friday night our Beijing team members were amazing, as always. The list goes on from breaking to break dancing. Yep, break dancing, skeptical as we were when the foot clan came out and started dancing to the music, they were fun to watch, with a Capoeira flavor to their movements, it seemed to belong. A number of people saw the father of modern wushu, Wu Bin, Applauding their performance. Overall, the tournament was smaller than last year's, but just as successful. Props to Li Jingheng.

 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 USWA's Results

 Peter, 4 Gold Medals plus Men's Internal All around Champion title.  Total 5 Gold Medals.
 Cynthia, Jivon's mom, 1 Gold medal.
 Jivon, 1 Bronze and 2 Gold Medals? (not sure about this yet)
 Chris, 2 Gold Medals.
 Philip, 1 Silver medal.
 Alexander, 3 Gold medals.
 Suzie, 2 Gold medals.

I think it is fun to go back and read these things.  Coach Pei and I at one time were really pushing the webpage for stuff like this.  But noone else every really put the effort into it.  It's too bad really, it could have been great fun to go back and read.   Heh, I am sitll tempted to demand that USWA take my work down off their webpage, but I don't think I am gonna do that.  I really wanna, but it seems too low on my part.  I don't think people understand how bitter I am to be dropped by them after pouring my heart out and workign as hard as I did.  Aggghhhh, I gotta let it go.  shesh.

As far as surfing the web goes I founda  great article written by Peter Wolf, Brandon S posted it on raffi's board -- but I think it is worth keeping, so here it is:

 SECRETS OF CHINESE WUSHU

 The following text is a compilation of journal entries from Peter Wolf written while he was training in China in 2002.

 Jumping Drills
 1. Improve you jumping:
 This isn't very scientific but this is the theory i've come up with in my training experience in china...
 Improving your jumping ability in Wushu is not that difficult, the secret is... FROG JUMPS, ALL THE TIME. Oh and also do them really fast.

 It's that easy. You know the exercise i'm talking about. The chinese athletes do them all the time! I watch the kids team and they do them ever practice (which mean everyday but sunday).

 More Jumping Drills
 Okay so a bit more on jumping drills (likely some of this is old hat, but for many it may be new).

 Here is an example of a circuit for jumping...

 1. Calf Raises 30, then sprint 50 meters. Pay attention during your sprint to be on the balls of your feet, running flat footed won't improve your jumps, oh yeah for the calf raises have some about the same weight as you sitting on your shoulders.

 2. V ups and airplanes 30 (or your max). Abs and hip flexors are really important for jumps too. Repeat these to excercises 3 sets then...

 3. One leg jumps (hop on one leg for distance and speed) about 30 meters then switch legs, each leg 4 times.

 4. Bend down jump straight up 3 sets 20. Similar to frong jumps but not as difficult, just strait up and down. Jump for height and extend you body in the air, relaxed landing. Like most of these drills to it really fast.

 5. Frong jumps 30 meters and back equals one set, do 4 sets. To answers Drake, I was told frog jumps should always be done last and done basically till you can't do anymore. The are the most strenous drill so if you do it first you shouldn't have strength for anything else.

 Lastly cool down and stretch a bit and if your lucky get somebody to give you a massage :)

 This circuit is from the Shanghai womens team (who recently did pretty well in the national qualifyers by the way) they do this 2-3 times a week.

 Flavor
 Flavor...ok so i've been asking some coaches and athletes around here about developing flavor, here's what i've come up with.

 1. First step is good basics of course, proper mechanics is most important, then add speed and power, and don't forget 'intent'. Intention is a little hard to explain but it should come from a inner focus and be expressed in the eyes (that intense far looking stare you can see in pro's for etc.) Snap, in the head and wrist and hips cad all be improved during basics as well (especially when your coach is always pointing out when you do it wrong).

 2. Combinations, after basics we always do combinations. Usually 3-5 movements from your set, weapon or empty hand. During combination you are working again, first on mechanics then speed and power, after that snap and the eyes. For example i'm recently discovering I often look down a little, not at the ground, but not proper posture looking straight out ahead or at my sword when i'm supposes to etc...

 Ok, so far none of this is strictly gonna improve flavor, but it doesn't hurt either. A coach explained to me that this stuff is most important, but flavor is important too. He said a lot of what people call "flavor" is the ability to use more of there body, but more hip and waist into movements, extend motions, relaxed and know when do go fast and when to go slow. This is what he told me might help;

 1. Most useful way is "Hua Dongzou" in chinese. Not sure i'm getting the translation correct but my interpretation of "Hua Dongzou" is to "draw your motions" or "paint your set". After practicing basics and combinations and sections of your set then go back and go through your set slow (maybe not taiji slow but real slow) think about each motion, exagerate every motion make it bigger more open. If you go slow and concentrate and repeat enough you should become more aware of your body each time you go through a section. Ex. first time through you put a little more waist in that slash, second time you put the waist and you make sure your eyes follow the sword the whole time, third time you make sure your back is straight and put more waist in and eyest follow the sword etc...you get the picture? k, not sure this is making sense (feedback?) anyway writing it out helps me think about ;)

 2. Watch lots of wushu! Watch carefully pick something to mimick once in a while, find movements that you like, you'll enjoy practicing more and should show through in performance. Now in saying this I don't think my coach meant go practice twists when you've just starting learning wushu. Pick smaller motions, details. This is not as usefull as the first for many of us do compulsory forms but i like to think that by practicing other movements and then comming back to old ones you can improve.

 Ok, hope that was worth reading. Lastly, the main thing i've heard chinese coaches gripe about foreign Wushu is "Wuxing" this can be divided into two things.

 1. No tempo in forms, everything one speed (even if it is fast) is not good. Some motions should be slow! Also if you go slow first then your next motion will look even faster in comparision (so i do a lot a taiji).

 2. No intention in the movement. Intention can be tough, but it helps to remember that Wushu is not dance! It is not gymnastics! And yes I know it's not real fighting either, but it is a display of martial skill. You should be concentration on putting full effort into every motion (again this doesn't mean just go fast) maybe i should say full body and mind into every motion. Look determined, like Clint Eastwood when its five on one in "For a few dollars More" (sorry just watched that, maybe just watch some pro chinese).

 The club makes frequent trips up and down the West Coast to participate in both Collegiate Wushu competitions and other Wushu related competitions. The team also participates in campus and community cultural events such as demos at the EMU Amphitheatre, Eugene's annual Asian Celebration, and the campus held Chinese New Year's event. In addition to performance and competition, club members form close friendships and participate in social events outside of the club.

Pretty sound advice.  This is the kind of thing I wish I could write up.  The kind of thing I need to be looking for while I train -- so I can write it down and not forget it.

As far as wushu goes these days, things are starting to change.  Forced big changes, but I think they will be for the better.  I went to O-Mei and watched a class with Josh Walters, my friend from the Tech Tae Kwon Do Club. I swear when I walked in I knew half the people there.  Well, maybe it was just 3 or 4 but is seemed like alot of people.  So many people have come form USWA to O-Mei to train.  It just says something.  I am going back today to take an intro lesson.  So far I like what I see there, it seems like a more sound choice than before.  I think I am gonna do it -- I am gonna go there.

I know is seems like all I ever talk about here is My Wushu Soap Opera.  But I don't get to talk to people nearly enough.  I mean I think about it all the time, I dwell on it way way way too much.  I guess this is as good of vent as any.  So I think I am gonna give you a few reasons.  Reasons why I should go to O-Mei (and thus leave USWA).

Reasons to leave USWA:
Sketchy Business Pratices By Coach Pei.
Coach Pei not talking to me.
Minimum Corrections From Coach Zhang.
Coach Zhang avoiding me out side of class.
Blatent Favoritism by the USWA coachs.
Suzie deciding she dosent like me.
Lack of better classmates at USWA, O-Mei has more good people to push me.
Lu Xaio Ling will converse with me.
Rene's case -- ignored at USWA, loves O-Mei.
So many of the good long time USWA students leaving for O-Mei (voting with their feet)
Money, much cheaper at O-Mei and there are more classes at much more times
Flexable Schedule at O-Mei
O-Mei is moving the school so it will be closer to my Apt in a few months.
High profile Demos
I can't do demos at USWA anymore (ZJL vetoed me a few times)
Sarah
Emily
Rene

Reasons to stay:
Paulo
Melanie
Peter
Glenn
Philip
Greg
Sean (however he was talking about quiting because of his grion)

I know there are more to put in both lists, but it is pretty apperent that the leaving seems like a more logical choice right now.  Too bad is it gonna burn that bridge back to USWA (if it even exists).  But how improtant is it to have a way to get back to some people who have proven that they will drop you ina second if you stop being useful to them.

I really need a life.

There are some more normal things going on.  I have been reading Neal Stephenson stuff recently.  I am into his book Snow Crash, and I am really liking it.  I have also found a few of his essays -- the guy seems to know his stuff about comptuers.  Not to mention I like alot of his views on life and philosophy.  Smart guy, don't know how well he will prove to be, but so far I am liking what I find.  I can't wait to get to his other books -- the Diamond Age looks interesting.  Man, and I got all those Hienlen books from my dad to read.  And just a few years ago I could have cared less about reading.  Who would have thought that the Jackie Chan My Story would turn me onto SciFi books.  And not the nice easy reading ones so much, I want good philosophy!  Geez.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Chris Documentation Project

I have a few reasones for doing this.  Prolly the most pressing one is that I am convinced that I am gonna forget some of the really cool things that have happened to me.  I want to remember all the people and places and things I have experianced.  Also I remember when My best friend Everett wrote his autobiography out in green marker, that was one fo the greatest things I have ever read.  I was truly impressed.  So I want to do a similar project, I journal/diary of sorts.  I am planning on going back to highschool at least in this, but I will need to sit down and figure out the timeline of stuff to some extent.  Not like the order is important or anything, but I need to brainstorm over the events that occured.  As for college, I think I am gonna get Kelly (my wife) to help me out -- she can draw up an outline for me and I can do the writeup or something.

Man oh man, I don't know where to start.  I want this to be readable by anyone with know knowledge of me at all, but I don't wanna start at the beginnign because of my lack of preperation. I guess I could do the preperation now, but i want something solid accomplished.  I have a few hours today I can write, I don't plan on writing for that long in the future, I just want to go back and get some of this stuff down.  then I can just transistion the project to a daily/weekly journal of the events that have happened to/around me.

I think this project will have to be more of a event/person driven flow rather than a time driven flow.  What I mean is I will write up the stories of certian things or people in my life.  So I am gonna write about some of my good friends first, from when I met them to now, this otta not leave too many gaps, and later I can just refer the these stories.  This way I can get things rolling, later I will just switch to a journal type entrys.  Man, I hope I can keep this going.  I really wanna comeback and read everything in my oldage to remember all the adventures I have had.  I love adventures.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[The tale of Qiu Dong Xing.

It was back in January of 2001.  My wushu school, USWA, was having a seminar from the head coach of the Beijing wushu team, Wu Bin.  I had only been doing Wushu for about 6 months, but I knew that Wu Bin was the biggest and baddest name in wushu.  This was granddaddy wushu.  And he was coming here to my school to teach a few classes.  it was great fun.  Even more fun when I found out that he was bringing one of the current Baijing Wushu Team members with him.  Qiu Dong Xing was amazing, spoke no english, but did some of the most amazing things ever.  Stuff that I had only seen on crappy VCD's from china -- so much more impressive when you see good wushu in person.  I was amazed at the intensisty and power he had.  1000's of times more power than anything I had ever seen in Tae Kwon Do or Karate.  My coach had him demostrate a few forms, he did a staff form faster than I had ever thought was possable, and his jumps were amazing.  I found out fromt eh other students that he was able to do a double twisting butterfly, that was amazing.  It was like th holy grail of tricks as far as I was concerned.  Needless to say I was quite impressed with this little chinese guy.

Well, it turned out that Qiu Dong Xing (QDX for short) was there to stay.  He was a new coach at our school.  My coach needed help teaching the ever growing classes at USWA, so the made more classes and split them up among the coaches.  Coach Pei, who primarily taught Taiji on the non-wushu days, was teaching his beginner classes and the little kids classes.  Basically he tought the classes where the people could be easily scared.  This was becasue of Coach Zhang.  Zhang Gui Feng was Chris Pei's wife, and she was fiesty.  I remember being scared of her in the beginner class, I did not wanna be promoted because she was alwasy yelling at her students.  I later became accustomed to it, just like everyone else who would stay at the school long enough to make it to the more advanced classes.  Coach Zhang was the real wushu coach, she was in charge of the wushu people.  And being a former professional wushu athlete in communist china was more than a little apparent. But she was a good coach, and really knew her stuff.  She had made the students there do things I really wanted to do.

Now QDX was teaching, he assisted in the early afternoon kids classes, then he took one of the intermediate classes all to his own, which happened to be my class.  The other coaches would would be in and out, but as time went by and he learned more and more english it came close to being just QDX teaching out class.  Everyone of us in that class like him, he was very nice to us and pushed the advanced people to get better.  A little hard to understand -- he would often ranbel off in chinese to one of the chinese speaking students and have them translate to the rest of us.

I remember that he did not know my name, not for a while, he was learning the names of some of the other students, and I was so jelous.  Even knew some of the names of the non-chinses speaking students.  Always helped paulo out, I was convinced it was because he knew his name.  I know paulo was very friendly and outgoing, and that had somethign to do with it, so I decided I would try.  I wanted to be his friend.  Maybe it was just how cool I tough it was that he was a beijing team member -- or that I though that he could teach me cool wushu tricks -- or something, I just wanted to be friends with him.

Then came that one class, he asked one of the otherstudents what my name was, and used it.  Hell, he remembered it to the next class and used it again.  I was so happy.  I tried to hard, I wanted to impress him with my crazy wushu skills.

Things continued like this for a while, we would ask him to come along when we went out.  Having dinner or hangin otu at someones house.  He was kinda reserved about it, acted sad.  Coach Zhang said he was depressed, and the coaches daughters had told me he was homesick.  Coach's oldest daughter told me he spent all his spare cash on phone calls to friends/family in China and California.  I felt so bad for him.  Kelly and I would frequently talk about what we could do to help him feel more happy here.  I knew living with the coaches and their daughters must have been hard.  He had grown up training in wushu for a job, living in the dorms at the Beijing team.  This must have been a hard transistion.

The coaches daughters hated him.  The girls would never stop complaining to their parents -- felt like he was invading thier space.  The complained that he had taken over their basements, and would make a point of showing it was their domain by going down there when ever they felt like it.  I tried to help them understand why giving him some space would help, but they are as stubborn as thier parents.  Poor guy, it appeared to me like he had gone away to college but had to live with a full blow nuclear family -- and they were his boss as well.  That has gotta suck.

Well things went on and it was getting closer and closer to QDX's 6 month visa running out.  I was starting to get worried.  Until one day, just out of the blue there was Tina.  I didn't know where she cam from or how QDX knew her, but there she was.  it seem like only a few weeks -- a month or two at most, they were there over at our house for dinner with a bunch of other wushu peeps and QDX told us they were married.  Go figure.  Tina was great, she was chinese but raised in america so spoke perfict english and woudl translate QDX for us.  Plus help us with our chinese -- a number of use were taking chinese class simply so we could talk to QDX.  Tina was a professional dancer, and was only gonna be in town for the summer when she had to go up north of a dance school thing, was only suposed to last a month or two.  Then she would return and be able to do the planning for the offical wedding in china.  But this ment QDX was staying in the US, and that meant I could keep training with him.  By now, I was starting to be real, honest to goodness friends with him.

In the summer we would all go play soccer at a local high school, it was QDX's idea, and we would just grab some wushu people and go out on saterday afternoons.  The girls would scream when we kicked the ball at them, the guys would show off trying to impress them screaming girls.  it was just healty natural fun.  The sun was hot and the soccer game was unorgnized.  I dont know if anyone ever won, we never could keep track.  Well, maybe we kept track, but the next day noone would remember.  I love being outside.  I loved bringing my wife out and playing some fun games with all my friends.  This was great.

Well, it seamed that the coachs were giving QDX everything he needed and more.  He had a place to stay, coach Pei's old car, and a monthly paycheck.  But he was looking for supplemental income, he did have a wife to support now.  And it is almost as hard to get a job as a professional dancer as it is for a professional wushu guy.  Well, every year there are a few big Sport karate trounaments in the area.  One of them is Capitol Classics.  The thing about sport karate is they always seem to have prize money.  You don't normally get anything unless you win grandchamption, but if you win, you get a thousand dollars.  QDX was in two divisions, so he had a shot at wining 2 grand.  Easy money for a all around china champion.

Well he went in, and won the forms grandchampion, I think he would have wone the weapons as well, but Sport Karate rules say if you break your weapons you are disqualified.  That really sucks because the judges heard a crack during his staff form in one of the run-off rounds.  None the less he still walked home with a pocket full of cash.

I remember talking to people online about him.  People from the rival schools wanted to train with him, kids from across the country were asking what it would cost to take private lessons fomr QDX.  Well, with my large web presence, and the fact that I sit online all day at work, I was able tot talk to so many people about him.  This started to grow as he started to compete.  It was crazy.

After capitol calssics he started competing in more sport karate events.  Kept winning them too, I don't know of any where he didnt win grandchamion in at least one of his two events.  He pretty much always wone.  I know he lost a few times in one division or the other, but he was able to pay his way with his earnings.  Well, not just his way, but also for Coach Pei and Tina.

This was the beginning of the end.

The coaches had QDX pay for coach Pei to travel along with them, but that was in exchange for insurance.  QDX could not afford to pay for the trip if he lost, so they said if he looses and dosent make any money, they will cover everything.  Both side though this was fair.  No one had any problems with any of the trips they went on.  Unfortunally both sides thought the other had problems.  I dont know what went on when, I was told the story later -- from both sides.  So this is all hear say, and I don't want to know more.  I am gonna include some of the story here because if I don't other things won't make sence.  Plus I learned alot from this and I don't wanna forget.

well, hold on, before I get into the details of the issues between the coaches and QDX, I wanna just finish how I saw things happen.

I knew he was winning tournaments, I kewn Coach Pei was travling along with them.  didn't know why, seemed like he wanted to network with the promoters and other schools out there, possably even start up his tournament again.  Donno, didn't put too much thought into it.

Preperation for QDX and Tina's wedding in china were underway, tina was only working part time so she could get suff arranged.  I know QDX spent lots of time on the phone to china setting things up.  Kelly was getting excited.  We had even talked about going, it would have been so much fun.  I missed out on a trip to china that summer because USWA had canceled their trip, and we would get to go to a chinese wedding.  But we didnt have the money or the time.

Well, a bunch of us set up a going away party for them at a local chinese buffet -- peter pan.  I have no idea why a chinese buffet would be called peter pan, but it was suposed to be pretty good. Kelly and I had shown up, but not every one was there, so we just kinda stood in the parking lot talking.  One of the students Keye was talking about getting a new job, and I remember someone said "you know keye, you can live off of less than fifty grand a year, I am living proof of that"  Tina reacted with a surprised face, and said "Whoa!  fifty thousand dollars, we are trying a lot less than that" or something along those lines.  We all made our way inside, and found seats.  Everyone kept going up for crablegs and sweat and sour chicken. After dinner QDX insisted that we all give him a list of stuff we wanted from china.  We fewlt really bad, but he was pushy, I tild him I wanted a Baijing Wushu team weapons bag.  I had hear they were so cheap there, so I figured it would not be too much for him.  Some people were asking him to bring them back shoes and sliks and weapons.  But a few of us insisted that those requests were too much, plus they should be supporting USWA and buying the stuff they can there.  So it ended up most people wanted Beijing Team Specific Stuff.  I think kelly wanted paper -- some sorta chinese stationary.

I remember that when coach Zhang was invited to the dinner that seh said it wasnt such a good idea.  I had no idea why, and when she explained it to me I had even less of an idea why.  "We no can support when we have bisness, in feel this is not how I want to do.  If I go then I say they are good people"  or something like that.  Later I had learned that this meant there was a falling out between QDX/Tina and the coaches, and they felt like they were doing them wrong, so they could nto attend or they would be supporting them.  I thought my friends were going away for a month to get married, and wanted to wish them congratulations in advance.

It wasnt until after they had flown to china did I understand what had gone on.  Coach Zhang Pulled the students one by one into her office and explained the situation.  Apperantly they had gotten suspecious of QDX/Tina trying to steal bisness away from them, and wanted QDX to sign a contract that he would not teach for anyone else, or even work anyother jobs while he was working there.  I was so surprised.  I knew that QDX could not get a job teaching Martail arts anywhere like he had here.  The coaches supplied him with a place to stay and a car and everything.  I was thinking we have skewed his vision of how much money he needed to live off of up here.  Pretty much everyone he was hanging out with was a yuppie, my self included.  I Felt like we gave him the impression that if you cannot pull off 50 grand you are gonna starve up here.  I wanted some way to reason with him, and tell him that all his friends would take care of him.  Paulo and I decided that we could build him a computer out of spare parts.  Kelly was replacing kitchen stuff, and was gonna donate her old (but good) stuff to the cause.  We just had to talk to him.  He would sign the contract after he knew how good of a deal it was.  I just knew it.

So I emailed him:

Subject: Hey crazy guys...

Hey Guys,

Hope you got out there just fine and every thing is going according to plan so far.  We are excited for you both - you are a wonderful, happy couple and it's great that you will get to go celebrate that.  We really wish that we could have come and hope that you understand the limitation that work puts on us in terms of travel.  But you two should relax some and have fun!  We will want to hear all about it when you get back - and will welcome any note you get a chance to send while you are there.

Anyway, I wanted to talk to you guys, Coach Z filled us in on the situation with USWA and the entire contract thing.  We sat down and had a pretty detailed conversation since she was looking for our input about whether or not she was being unreasonable.  But I wanted to know if you guys would let us talk to you before you made any permanent decisions.  I believe that I have a good understanding of being a martial arts instructor in the US; I have done research and much thinking about teaching for a living.  If you guys want to go do something other than teach wushu, that's cool with me, but if you want to continue teaching I really think we should talk (or email) a
bit.

I know that we have talked about this a little in the past, however I never wanted to get into details because I didn't want to be impolite.  But I believe there may be a few things you might be overlooking or the coaches have been a little unclear about but have now explained to us.  Also, you may have been inadvertently mislead a little by Kelly and I (as well as a few of the other people in our class) about the cost of living round here and the quality of life that can be achieved; I want to make sure that we clear these things up.  You should also know that there are plenty of us that want to and can help make getting started in your own place much
easier - and that offer stands regardless of where you decide to work.

I don't want to start dishing out advice, especially as you have a lot of other things to be busy with right now, but would like to offer it to you. Or at least an open ear and someone to talk to about all of this. I really think it would be good to hear you side of the story, and to try to fill you in on the way it (it what?) is supposed to be (as apposed to the way a few of us make it sound).  But if you want to hear what I have to say, please say so.

So you know, coach has no idea that I am talking with you, and I would like to keep it between us so there are no other complications or sense of interference.  I simply consider you guys good friends, and no matter where you work Kelly and I would love to be "Hao Peng You".

Love,
Chris & Kelly

hi there,

thanks for thinking about us.  We're happy to hear from you!!  everything is going well so far.  We've been busy everyday since we got here.  We didn't even have time for ''jet-lag,'' because xingxing's friends couldn't wait to see him and his newly wed'K that's me.  :P

you and Kelly are a wonderful, nice couple, too, and it's great to get to know you guys.  We were really looking forward if you could make to the wedding, but of course we understand the limitations. Don't worry, we'll send you guys the pics as soon as get them.

it would be great if I can know a little about it.  I didn't even think about doing any research because we believed we would be helping coach zhung for some time.  Do martial arts instructor usually have other jobs?

let's do that.  ''  in reality, we know that xingxing's career will not go too far from teaching wushu.  Because that's what he's good at, rt?  Oh, and do you have any suggestion for him about his teaching?  Because he would like the students to enjoy his class.

It's our pleasure to meet all these nice people when we moved to this new city.  We know that you guys are doing as much as you can, and we'll always remember that, too.  Especially xingxing, he has so many ''brothers'' because when someone's good to him, he does double good for the others.  As for me, I grew up in the church, I always see the good sides of the people and remember it.  That's why I felt so sad two days before we left.  Coaches asked us what did we do, because why would someone ask if coach qiu's still teaching in uswa in the internet?!  They believe either xingxing or i must said something outside.  We don't know why that happened because we've thought that xingxing will be teaching for them in their new school in MD.  That's also why we still couldn't decide if we should rent apt in MD or not.  Didn't people or  them see that?  I guess
it's very possible that others don't know it's still coach zhung's school in MD, so they asked that question.  Coaches didn't believe us (or I should say ''me,'' since they believe I have been planning xingxing's future and telling others without him knowing.)  I wish things could go back to the way it was, but it's kind of impossible with my effort since we found that's why coach zhung didn't talk to us/me the last week we were there.

We would like your advice.  You don't know how much I appreciate this email and your thoughts.  Trying our best to have a good relationship with the coaches has been bothered us since we told them that xingxing will still represent uswa for the competitions but we'll use our own money.  (if you want to know our side of the story, I can tell you next time.)  we still couldn't be happy on the plane.  Although xingxing and I try not to talk about it too much (since we've done our best, and there's not much for us to tell them to change the situation), but I know we still think about it'K We needed some suggestions when things started to go ''wrong,'' but then we realized that we didn't have other friends other than ''their students.''  Felt lonely and sad that we couldn't share any of these with you'K  don't want you guys to be involved.  However, we did ask Peter, as one of uswa's employees, if it's ok for xingxing to use his own money instead of uswa's for competitions.  We found out that it's no more xingxing's choice to go to the competition or not as uswa's employee.  That's one of the two reasons xingxing thought about when coaches talked to us two days before we left.  xingxing came here to teach, but now it seemed like he doesn't have much freedom about competition or other activities in the morning/ not during class time.  The second reason xingxing doesn't like is that coaches do not want me, tina, to be closed with their students if xingxing still work with them.  I know I'll be sad if that's what needs to be done.  They think that I am taking away their students.  but why would I do that?  We already assured them that we're not going to have a school, at least not anytime soon.  Xingxing doesn't want us to give up all these friendships because his job, and he would like me to have the freedom to hang out w/ whomever I like to. From the way they talked, I know they might think that we're not satisfied with the salary or something (please tell me if I'm wrong).  Xingxing and I, as traditional Chinese people thinking, we respect the elders.  Especially xingxing and coach zhung have the same coach, so xingxing wants to be ''hao peng you.''  But we do need the freedom to survive (reason one: to do what he wants in his free time) as a family (reason two: to have friends together and not be separated).Heehee, I think I've said too much'K  please tell us what you have to say.  We'll be glad to hear.

us, too'K..

Subject: Talkin' time....

Hey guys,

Hopefully you have recovered from jet lag already, but 13 hours is a big change.  I guess I will find that out for sure this summer when I go out there for Wu Bin's Tournament.   And trust me Kelly and I wish we could be over there now,  Kelly mostly because if we would have gone for the
wedding we wouldn't have to train.  For some reason she doesn't want to train
every day all day like me  =)

We though you sanded sad that last time I talked to you, so I asked the coaches about it and got this big explanation about business issues.   Basically she said that she asked Xing Xing to sign a contract saying that he can't do any wushu related business with out USWA permission.

The reason she wants this is because she is scared for the school,  she has been screwed over in the past by people who were working with her and she simply doesn't want to leave any possibility for conflict between the coaches, so that they can concentrate on their job.  I don't see why this contract cannot allow for Xing Xing to compete with his own money and therefore keep all the winnings.  There may be some red tape involved but it should be easily worked out.  But the mostly want to find a way to protect their school, and are worried that if you guys ever decided to split off that you could take half the school with you.  She did not say this explicitly but you can tell that it is her biggest worry.

I think she figures that it could possibly be a snowball effect,  so that it would all happen over time but build up --  however she should not need to worry about that as long as all of Xing Xing's wushu teaching is done with USWA.

I was unclear about how you guys responded to when the coaches asked you to sign a contract.  I had no idea of the terms of the contract or the duration.  But I have talked to coach Zhang and she says that she doesn't know them and was going to get you guys to agree to sign it before the shy paid the lawyer to write it.   Honestly i think all this should not be needed, but that would require total trust and loyalty.  And after getting screwed over a few times I understand why the coaches think the way they do.  I probably would too in their situation.

With all this said and with the large amounts of control USWA wants over anything wushu related, I still think you guys have  a great deal with USWA.  Mostly because you don't have to deal with the business side, only the teaching part.  And most martial arts schools go bankrupt because of that business reasons.  Even if the coach has amazing credentials and experience.   But I would say as a standard in the US it takes years for a marital arts school to get going, and normally during that time the owner must work extra outside of the school in order to support it.  I don't know if you already knew this or not, but don't take offence.  And you have to understand that if you compare the salary that a bunch of us (people like
Me, Keye, Greg, and Paulo) make, you are comparing the wrong things.  I remember the comment that Greg said to Kaye -- you know Keye, you can live off of $50,000 a year, I am living proof.  Well, I think that gives you guys the wrong impression.   If you listen to us too much we will skew your view of how things are supposed to be.   While one day you may easily be able to blow money on things like a motorcycle like the coaches do, it takes a bit of work to get to that point.

I think the work will be a lot less and much easier with this little internship at USWA for you guys.  Think of it like a doctor doing his residency, your pay is crap and hours suck for a while, but it pay off in the end.   I am positive the coaches don't intend for you guys to continue teaching at their school forever, and I know they don't want the trouble of running a bunch of schools by themselves so they will want to spin the other schools off to be owned and operated by other people.  Coach Zhang has offered to let me use their name and curriculum when I want to start my own school, that's a big deal.  I know so many successful instructors that would never let a student do that.  or would charge a bunch of money to do
so.   She tells me that all she wants in return is for us to buy uniforms and weapons from her.  Not that I would even know where else to get them.

As far as when things went wrong, I cannot say for sure.  Maybe it was when you started your dance class or wanted to pay your own way to the tournaments.  I understand why Coach Zhang doesn't like those things, but
I pretty much don't agree.  However I think it will prove to be pretty minor once other details get worked out.

Of course you didn't have friends outside of USWA.  You guys were up rooted and plopped right in the middle of a strange city where most people didn't speak your (well, Xing Xing's) language.  That makes things very hard.  So there is very few ways to meet new people.  Nearly all the friends that I have in the DC area are from USWA (the only exceptions being college friends). I know many people who only have friends from work.    But over time it will change, but is take a while.    As far as our friendship with you guys, we don't care where you work, we will be friends.

The contract that Coach told us about might be a plus in other ways to you guys.   If you sign promising not to teach wushu anywhere else, then you have an exact set amount or restriction placed on you, and if something is not mentioned in the contract then you can assume it is OK for you to do.  I am certain that the contract would not have any restrictions on who you can be friends with.  so that would help clear up one point.  Plus it would probably make coach Zhang much more secure and therefore more relaxed
once she gets rid of the fear that Xing Xing has the ability to cripple their business.   And now they know he is married and they know he will agree with you, just like he should, so if you decided against USWA he
would follow you.  Not that you would, but you could.

I don't think coach Zhang ever said outright that is was too little money, but that is sorta what I assumed.  I understand that it seems very overwhelming.  Kelly have been there and felt that plenty.  But I don't see why your two concerns could not be met, especially as long as Xing Xing doesn't want to spend his free time teaching classes at O-Mei  =) .

Kelly and I will be there if you need us, no strings attached.  In fact we seriously talked about sharing a house with you guys, it would help us pay for one and you guys could get a cheap place to stay that involved no other business obligations.  Just an idea that we have talked about.   Once you guys move out of the coaches house you will find that you have much more freedom,  however that freedom has a price, so it will cost you much more to live than it does at their house.  It should just like children living
with their parents.  The parents always want more control -- and I think weather or not coach Zhang wanted it to be this way he can't help it, she's a mom.   When Kelly lived at home the summer before the wedding she complained about the exact same things.   Moving out might just solve almost all of you problems.  But it would create new ones too.

So my advice to you, is to come back and give in to the coaches at first.   I think they really have a great deal set up for you guys.  Let some time pass to let things settle.  I bet in a year this will be all but forgotten,  after you have had a chance to prove your self.  Once you don't have the wedding and trip to china hanging over you it will be much easier to live when you work full time.   If need be Xing Xing can get a part time job, I am sure he could find work in the Chinese community some where.   Hopefully it won't require 2 jobs for him, but I don't think that it would be too difficult with his schedule at USWA.   Just a little annoying.

Have fun over there and hurry back,  Kelly keeps saying she misses her Coach.

We love you guys,

Chris and Kelly.

Subject: will talk more :)

Dear Chris and Kelly,

Thanks for even thinking about sharing the house with us.  That's very, very sweet of u.  Like xingxing said, although he didn't understand what you guys talk about most of the time before, but he knew you are a nice couple he's ever met in US.

There are 4 things xingxing would like you to know on the issue''

First, coach zhung is a former bejing wushu team's member, I respect her because she's older and doesn't matter if she was known in the team or not.  That's why i never mind about what she can offer me.

Second, about future, we never really think about opening a wushu school.  (Which we told the coaches, and we also let them know that we'd never take any student from their school).  But I don't want tina totally
gives up her dancing, that's why I would like tina to do anything relates to dance.  If I have any thought about opening a wushu school, I would of try to learn some business side of uswa the past yr.  But I didin't.

Third, if it's you'' working in a computer co. Without effecting the company, will you be ok if the company still bother you with what you do after work??  It's impossible for me to teach anywhere else if I'm
teaching at uswa''  it's a basic principle for ''basic human being.''  I assure this to the coaches already, so they know this is the way I do things.  But I do need my freedom.  (tina had an idea for us to show chinese culture (dance and wushu) to public schools in the mornings.  I don't understand why do we still need permission from my boss''  of course I don't mind telling them, but they don't seem like they want me to do anything besides teaching at uswa (or go to english class).  Does that mean my wife can't have certain jobs she wants because my boss doesn't want
me
to?  It's even more awkward if we really want to do what we want and they ''kind of'' not allow.  Ex: competition.)  It's impossible for me to do anything to harm uswa, but I can't accept or agree to be controlled when I do everything.  I bet no one likes it, even in China.  (Tina: I don't think move out will help, because it's about what we do outside not at home.)

Forth, I stay in uswa because I respect them (1st contract already ended in June 2001), and of course I enjoy hanging out w/ you guys.  If I think about my own future, I would have more opportunities when I'm still young, if I'm not in uswa.  I stayed in uswa because I wanted to thank them for being nice to me and help them with what they need.  However, there were some things they did I couldn't accept.  I don't want to do anything to effect uswa, so I'll leave''  let the facts to prove what I said.

It doesn't matter what the life will be from now on, at least I know I'll be happy.  I'll still be friends with them.  Our friendship will always be there.  You're all nice people, and doesn't matter where we'll be, we'll still be good friends.

Tina:
Thank you for your advices.  we would always like to listen to your opinion.  I know I can't compare with other people's living
stander.  However, I do know about how much we need to start a family.  Of course I can see this as an internship, but the truth is that what can we get pay off?  We're not thinking about opening a school.  Like xingxing said, we stay there because we want to help the coaches.  After few yrs of working there, we need to start our new career, and we don't think it's worth it anymore if they don't appreciate the effort''Xingxing doesn't want to go into too detail (as he said ''there were some things they did I couldn't accept.'')  but there are something I would like you to know''  We understand coach zhung's unpleasant history, and we can do as much as we can as long as they can be reasonable = still think about us as friends.  we can't give up our right or reedom for something we didn't do, rt? of course we'll be happy if there's someone do the business side of work, however there was even problem when xingxing tried to compete with his own money (we respectfully asked three times.  From my point of view they didn't ''agree'' for us to do so.  They gave up their side at the end because xingxing didn't want to do anymore competition under that condition for another yr, which was what they wanted him to do.)  They specifically told us that the ''contract'' they want xingxing to sign will be all about everything they want xingxing to do.  From the tone they told us, we know that we are not going to have any choices like using our money for competitions.  It might sound nicer when they told you it's about protecting the school, however it's also about them making profit, too.  For us, it's not called a "contract" because we are not going to have our voice anymore.  Will you sign something like that?  I would really like to go back to before when we're all big family without conflict of interests''  I would really like to work out them more than anything, however I know it's hard '' especially there are also other issues, too.Anyhow, we still have chances to talk more when we go back, rt?  :)  can't wait to see you guys again, too!!

Yours,
Xingxing & Tina
------------------------------

That pretty much sums up what happened while they were gone.  You can clearly see how I understood my coach and her side of the story.  Things died down while they were gone, we all missed them and couldnt wait till they returned.  They were suposed to come back after about a month -- sometime in the beginning of January.  However on the day they were suposed to show up we heard word that there was a problem with QDX's Passport and Visa and that he was not allowed to leave China.  We got a little worried, but tina sent us an email explaining that it was just some paper work mistake and they would be returning in a few weeks.

Well, the time for their return was upon us, and we were so excited.  Their flight got bumped back to saterday and they guy who was suposed to go pick them up had to teach, so I jumped right in.  I was so excited to see my friends.  In fact, during our regular friday night after-wushu-go-out-to-dinner, we stayed late at IHOP talking about weather not not they were gonna return to teach at USWA.  Our fingers were corssed, we wanted him to come back.  I knew if they (the coaches and the Qius) could set their diffrences aside that the school would benifit.  The more super-qulified instructors there the better.

We got to the air port early, sat around.  The walls in Dulles airport have these huge concreat supports that go up at an angle.  They were about 4 feet accross and went up at curve to the celing -- starting off at a nice 45 degree angle or so.  I climed up the walls and Kelly told me to get down. Suddenly my playing was interupted by a muffeled "Chris!" from down the escolator.  It was QDX!   We ran down and gave Xing xing and Tina a big hug and chit chatted while we waited for their luggage.

Well, in that chit chat we talked about them teachign at USWA, and they basically told us there was no chance.  Well, we went to a local Chinese Food place, A&J's.  It was in a building with a chinese grocery store and some other chinese shops.  QDX went over to the bulitin board to try to find places to stay.  They were only gonna be in town for 2 weeks so they wanted to find a cheap place.  We would have nothing to do with it, they were our friends and they sould stay at our house.  We didnt have a bed for them, but plenty of floor space.  I mean, they were stuck here because their flight had been booked weeks ago and plus there was another big Sport karate tournament on that last weekend.  Made sence to us.  Kelly and i decided that we should have our house open to anyone as long as it was no danger to us.  Plus Tina and Xing xing would cause practically no inconvenience -- we might even be able to help them mend relations with the coaches and they could possably make that long shot and return to teaching at USWA.

We swung them by the coaches house to pick up some stuff.  Coach was a little distant, didnot talk to them at all, and she wanted to know where they were staying.  I said they wanted to say at a hotel, but I didn't plan on letting them.  Besides being somber and quiet, she did nto let on that anythign was wrong with that at all.  I pretty much took that as an "OK,"  cause in the past if she did not agree with something she would be very outspoken about it.  Even if it was none of her business.

Once we got home Kelly set up a nice bed upstairs in the loft of our apartment.  We stayed up talking about all sorts of things.  We over analized the coaches and their intentions.  We talked about making movies, the comptition coming up, and married life.  So nice.  Pretty much this contineud for the rest of the time they were there.  And let me tell you my chinese was getting much better.

Kelly decided she wanted to make them a welcome back dinner, she had been planning to do so ever sence they left actually.  Any excuse to entertain.  I swear she would use up all her money in college to feed me and my buddies.  Now that we were married she was using my money to feed all of my buddies.  A few of her's too.  We called all of our friends up.  Weird thing about all of our friends:  I used to spend all of my spare time at USWA, that kinda leads to all of my friends being from USWA.  I mean, right out of college I moved up here and didn't know but 3 or 4 people in the area.  All but one of those people are just "people I know" types, no friends.  Strangly enough QDX had a similar situation, the only people he knew were the ones from his teaching days, these people happen to be the ones who hung around and did stuff with the gang from USWA.  Go figure.  OK, I am sure you think I am rambling on about the obvious -- but this is important.

Nice dinner, all our friends had a good time.  Just played video games, ate some great food, and hung out.  Didn't even talk about USWA -- other than to say it was time for QDX to move on.  A nice stress free evening.  That was one of the last stress free times I would have for a long time.

I went to USWA and the coaches were being crazy distant.  I tried to talk to them but would get short-one-word-go-away answers.  Well, I gave it a few days, but I had found out that coach was pissed off about the "party."  So I went in on Wenesday and talked to her.  We talke for more than 2 hours, it was so long, and she basically told me she now questioned my loyality and integrety.  I was hurt.  I did not know what to do, I honestly felt like I did nothing wrong.  But in her eyes I was helping the evil Tina spread her propaganda to all of her Students and Instructors (the friends QDX and I have in the area).  She felt like she was being underminded and talked about behind her back.  I must have heard that you cannot have you feet in diffrent boats with out falling into the watter a dozen times.  Well there was much talked about, many things repeated, but in the end it boiled down to coach telling me not to get involved with USWA business and to not hurt the school.  I told her that I had never done anything I would ahve ever thought would hurt the school, and that i had only indended to help.  She insisted I had crossed the line.  It was the party that was the step too far.

The next day I asked coach Pei if I could talk to him.  It was a very frustrating conversation.  Getting him to talk is quite a task and always has been.  I think he keeps his mouth shut most of the time and observes to try to get you to answer your own questions.  Well I wanted to know his openion so I would sit there and wait until he would answer.  I was shaking the entire time, when I did talk my voice would crack.  I was nervious and upset, USWA had become my life and I felt like I was about ot be kicked out.  Coach Pei did reassure me that I am a paying student and that I would always be treated equal in class because of it.  But he also told me that he will not associate with dishonest and unlyoal people out side of class.  It hurt, he didnt say I was bad, but did tell me he thought I was "branching out."  I had not thougth of it as getting connections like that, but in fact I had been.  What could I do, and why should I not be allowed to gain more connections in the wushu world besides him and his wife.  But I did not think that at the time, I felt like I had betrayed my coaches and never knew what I was doing.  I explained that I felt horriable for anytrouble I had caused him and he went on to explain that I had helped QDX make him look bad.  Apperently he considered it a slap to his face every time we took QDX out to dinner, or when a bunch of people paid for his ticket to an amusement park.  You see, we would invite QDX out to go do stuff with us, but he would decline and say he wanted to save his money, but we being in the yuppies that we were would often all chip in and pay his way.  We thougth that the coaches were doing all they could to help QDX feel at home here -- so we were gonna help them by taking our friend out.  Now suddenly all those times we loaned him DVDs or bought him a burger were considered insults to coach Pei, because we had to help QDX sence USWA did not pay enough.  I never though of it that way.  Nor did anyone else I talked to.  But the coaches at USWA felt like they could only ask for a certian number of favors from their students and every time QDX or Tina got some help they would loose one of their favors.  The way he originally said that was by telling me that he saw QDX and Tina using his students.  That he could not stand by and see his students being used.

I left that conversation with coach pei in tears.  I was devistated and I didn't know why.  I thought I had blown it with the coaches and couldnt figure out where I went wrong.  I asked to for what was business and what wasent, but was told that was for me to figure out.  I figured it kinda hard for me to not be involved with business there -- i had been for quite a while, but now it was bad.  Lets take a look at my involvment there.  First of all I was a paying customer there, that kinda made me involved don't ya think?  I also did alot of computer realted work for them.  I mean that is my day job, so i figure I could help -- I helped wire the place for eathernet, trouble shot the computer systems, fixed the printers, and did the entire webpage.  This was a pretty major website, and Coach Pei wanted more and more, I was developing robust PHP scripts to interface with mysql databases -- creating new content and updating the reoutene stuff.  It was a full time job, and Coach wante bigger and better.  I was all gung ho for it too, I was proud to be helping with such a content rich portal.  I mean our involvment with the coachs back then was also personal, we took their daughters to the Zoo, went to dinner with them and came over for the girls bithday partys.  It was both sides of the coin and I was happy with how everyting was.

On the plus side this falling out was good for my marrage.  I would ignore kelly so I could do work for USWA, we can't go out of town because I signed us up to teach wushu at a local chinese school on the weekends.  This little soap opera forced me to look at what is really important.

Well, I had another talk with Coach Zhang, and things were really starting to come around.  She told me only time could tell.  So we would just have to wait it out.  Things were starting to settle, I could train again, and started to sleep at nights.  That's when the news broke, I had found out that Sarah was leaving USWA for the rival school a the same weekend that QDX and Tina came back.  Sarah was the last remaining wushu black belt, and had been a student for over a decade there.  I was really sad to see her go.  Even sadder to find out the problems I would have when coach found out she was leaving.

Emily was another black belt student of coach Zhang, but had left a a ew months back before sarah.  She knew that telling coach was pretty much pointless and just kinda let things hanging allowign Coach Zhang to assume it was her buisy college schedule that kept her out of classes.  Well, things started getting messy because QDX had returned -- she broke down and told coach that she was out of USWA.  There were a number of people who split for the rival school, O-Mei.  Most people left because they felt ignored by the coaches at USWA, and were fed up with coaches quick temper (at least that is what they told me).  Coach did not see it that way.  You know what drove them away?  Tina.  Coach blamed Tina.  Tina was schemeing and deceitful and evil in her eyes.  And you know who helped Tina do these evil tasks?  Me.  All the stuff I had done trying to help out the young couple had been direct attacks on USWA -- and now we have proof.  Students -- the best students at that -- were leaving for the rival school.

Well, that made life suck.  I felt so bad that I went as far as to ask QDX and Tina to go stay at another place.  There was a nice Chinese couple who lived in the apartment complex next to us -- not connected to USWA in anyway, and they allowed to for our friends to crash in their extra room.  I feel bad about it now.  I don't think I should have asked them to do that, but once I hinted that it might help things with the coaches they insisted.

It turned otu to be helpful with, because in one of my following talks with coach I broke down and told her what I had told them and to her it won me bonus points. Not worth it, but helpful.  The saga raged on long after QDX and Tina left for California, but once coach had the "do you know who is leaving" talk with me it started to simmer down.   Sarah cam back and did a demo with USWA, even told coach she was gonan return -- even though she had no intention of it as far as I can tell.

Oh, it was during that demo that my mouth had cought up to me.  I had talked to everyone I could that was on the inside trying to get advice.  I got plenty of great insight -- but there was one person that basically told me to just kiss up to coach and do what ever she said.  This lovly person was quite an impressive brownnose that of couse coach loved her.  I mean, I would love anyone who did everything I said with out question.  Well, I had told some people that he advice to me was to distance my self form QDX as much as possable.  Well, someone asked if she said I I should kick them out on the street, and I agreed.  Things went around and got juicer on the way -- as then tend to do -- until it got back to coach and her prize student.  There was a big ruckus about how I as slandering her and making everyone hate her.  I apologized and said I never intended to make people hate her.  Now I understand why everyone had told me to no tell her anything and to no invite her out -- she just rats everyone out to coach (and I was finally getting to like her).  I guess this marked the peak of the drama, it is all down hill form here.

Things started to settle, I get ignored by coach pei.  Half the time he won't ever return my hellos.  But Coach Zhang is the main wushu caoch, and she is back to actually training me again.  Thank God.  I mean, I would go to another wushu school if I had to (well, maybe I would just go back to TKD for while) but I dont' wanna.  I have so many good friends there at USWA.  While we would not intend to stop being friends I would not get to see them very often, and we would drift apart.  In my exteriance there is no way around that -- we simply live too far apart and are too wrapped up in out buisy little activities.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[April 11, 2002

Well, I really wanna get back to writing more history before it drifts from my head forever, but I also need to sit down and outline stuff a little bit before I can do that.  So many projects I want to get accomplished, why can't I get paid for my pet projects I just don't know.  Hmmm, lets list them out.

-Writing the Chris Documentation Project
-My Movies (Peking Duck Productions)
	-Quality Action Movie -- something with preplanning and real pratice
	-Re-editing all the old ones into a good format
	-Making a DVD of all the old stuff
	-Learning the software to make the stuff (Final Cut Pro 3 and After Effects 5.5)
	-Making bumpers/logos/ect for Peking Duck and Fuzzy Monk
-Webpage stuff
	-update Fuzzymonk
	-MAke some content for Peking Duck
-Praticing Wushu
-Praticing Acrobatics
-Making My Wife Happy
	-She gets "wampthy" way too easy (plus it is crazy easy for me to fix if I am just paying attn to her)
-Time with God

Hmmm, I guess the list is not as long as I thought (and in no specific order).  I guess a large part of it is making them silly movies.  I don't know exactly why I want to put so much effort into them, I know there are much easier ways to impress people.  So it can't be just an ego thing.  I think it has to do with the fact that I think I am good at such a variaty of things, and making movies requires me to use just about every thing I know how to do -- Martial arts to Photoediting, Camera Angles to doing a backflip.  It's all in there.  Technical Computer stuff.  Martial Arts and Acrobatics.  Photolayout and graphic design.  So many dimentions to it and I think I can be good at all of them.  I don't think I am being egotistical about it, but I do want to make quality good art that I can be proud of.

I guess I have always been like this.  I was always much more interested in creating than competing.  Well, I guess I think of creating as competing -- I want to build things and design stuff.  I always enjoyed that sorta thing more than I did the team sports type activities.  Maybe it is because it is a more internal challenge to see what you can make your self do.  I mean it is cheezy an dcan be applied to all that other stuff, but that is kinda how I view it.

I was always into the activities that take a good deal a patience.  I mean when I was young (and well into the not so young stages) my favorite activity was building with legos.  I would easily do it for hours upong hours.  Legos were unique, they did not need anyone else there to help you, you can just toil away and build better and better stuff.  You just had to think it up, you coulnt mess up, you just might have to go back a few steps.  If you stuck to it long enough and just put in the effot you would create the coolest stuff.

Well, I would watch those specials on Discovery about college students building robots or race cars and thought how cool those projects were.  I even longed to build that drop-a-raw-egg-protector-box thing that I saw kids doing in highschool.  Man, I wanted to do that stuff.

Growing up I would translate my desire to create into a number of things.  Drawing.  I loved to do it, but never thought my stuff was very good.  People would always tell me that they liked what I drew.  I even remember people asking me if I was going to go work for disney.  They only said that becase there was another kid in my school who actually drew for disney, and I was no where close to as good as he was.   I could only draw a few things that I had learned the tricks to, he could draw anything.

Building.  I loved to build stuff, not very complicated things but what ever I could.  I would learn the "trick" to makign somthing and I would use that trick anywhere I could.  Like lashing -- the tought us how to lash sticks together in scouts.  I was then able to steal some twine fomr the garage and made a few tree forts way up in the air.  I was lucky that they never collapsed.  But I mean when I think back on them they were huge.  I guess I am glad I can't see them today, it would prolly be dissapointing.  I mean I would try to build other things by hand, either out of wood or wath ever I could find, normally I would just kinda have to improvise to make what it was I wanted.  Rarely would it come out to be useful.

When I think about it the transistion to using computers and cameras was natural.  Just about all of the elements I liked in my previous activities would translate into the new medium.  The only thing that didnt was the Martial Arts.  Thank God, at least this way it kept me away from the computer.   But the drawing on a computer was natural, I just had to sit down and learn how to do it.  I originally would work on a pixel by pixel basis on Paint.  I remember making a tileing background that everett would not beleave I made.  it was of a Guitar and Keyboard and had wires that would attach from tile to tile.  And up I went to drawing in photoshop long before you were suposed to draw in it.  and eventually graduated to the more advanced Vector drawing apps, but that transistion did not really occur until after college.  I remember drawing black lines with a Sharpie on white paper then scanning it in so I could have the line I wanted in photoshop.  Heh, it was such a hack.

But going back to my martal arts.  I remember when the Ninja craze hit: I wanted to be a ninja so bad. I wanted to be the karate kid.  American Ninja was so cool.  The other things that really intrested me was acrobatics.  I remember trying to lean jump rolls and spinning kicks before I started taking Martial Arts.  I also remember being imbarrased by my inablity to control my body.

I remember one time in California -- before I started taking Tang Soo Do -- The kid next door to me asked if I could show him a "round house" kick.  I told him I can't unless I have a target, so he told me to kick one of the bushes in front of my house.  So I jumped up and did some sorta weird spinning back kick (which is what i thought I round house was) and it was horrable.  I am pretty sure the other kids laughed and told me it was "not bad" in a mocking tone.  Ugh.  I wanted to be cool like the Kickboxer.

If we went to someone house that had a trampolene I would refuse to eat or play or anything so I could jump on it the entire time.  I was getting soem cool stunts like a front flip and some sorta butt to knees to back tricks I just sorta made up.  I didnt know what to do once I could land a front flip.  I mean, had been doing front flips onto the couch cusions ever sence we lived in Alaska.  Back flips were way out of my league.  They were like the holy grail of tricks.  Across the street and around the corner in Cali lived a kid named Jim.  Jim had a trampolene.  I remember talkign about back flips with him and to us they seemed impossable.  He would tell this story about how his sister once tried one, and she flew way off the tramp and landed on the fence.  Almost died of course and it was all sorts of scary.  Eventually my family got a trampolene, such a happy day.  I didnt beg for it or anything, I mean it had been years sence I had even jumped, and one day when I was in highschool my mom brought it home.  Everett, my sisters, my parents and I set it up right away.  I eventually got a back flip on it, however it was kinda strange, I built up to it by kinda going backwards at an angle.  I just sorta worked my way over.  It was not a clean backflip, but it was a back flip.  I was happy with that, sorta.

When we moved to Cali I switched to Tae Kwon Do, a martial art I was told had lots of high flashy kicks.  Well that was fine by me.  I learned every one I could.  If it was taught I wanted to know how to do it.  I praticed every thing over and over.  I got pretty good at that stuff, but I had run out of tricks to learn there. I would have to wait for college to learn real acobatics and tricks.

Beleave it or not all that also factored into the desire to make movies.  I loved martial arts, and the part that was my favorite was the big flashy moves.  No everyone could do those.  Sometime I would go places and be the best at the flashy stuff.  I was not very often the best at something, and now I had started to figure out my niche.  The best thing about doing flashy stuff on flim is you don't have to get it right the first time.  You had "undos" -- I would eventually get it, I just need a few takes to get the one I want.  That was like adding a <ctrl>-z into martial arts.  Stinking amazing.  You know when I would put on shows for my parents in the basement of our house in Alaska, and I would mes up a flip of a spin I would yell "hold on hold on, lemme try agian, I'll get it."   But now I can do that and the audience will never know.  To me that is great.

I know I can do it good.  I just need to time to and effort to make it that way.  If I am able to create what I want, I can teach others how to do it.  If I am not able to make the quality stuff then I don't have any place in teaching others.  No matter how much "head knowledge" I have.  I need to prove it to myself in pratice. I know this may not be all that valid, but it is improtant to me.

I know I will be on the right path when I can make a short action movie that makes people say "whoa, I need to watch that again"

Hmmmm, don't know if I should delete that las paragraph or not.  Dosent quite fit, and may not be accurate.  But for now it will stay.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[April 24, 2002

Ugh.  I have never had problems with alergys until I moved to VA, and I swear this year is by far the worst.  I guess it makes sence, they are saying that last week we had the higest pollen count in the washington area ever. So much flem.  I actually have been given a perscription to FloNase, you know a spray it up you nose type drug.  Kelly is getting me to take her Entex (which has been known to make me hyper) but I forgot to yesterday and today.  Actually I mostly remembered today -- the entex is sitting in a pile of other pills which I forgot to take this morning.  The other pills were my vitamins and whatnot.

The worst thing is when my nose runs I get this sore under it.  Lots of little blisters type sores right under my nose.  It is realy bad today.  Normally if I coat it with chapstick when I am blowing my nose I can help prevent it, but that did not work this time.  It's really embarassing, I am kinda avoiding my coworkers so they don't have to look at it.  Actually this time I have the sore on the inner edge of my right nostril -- instead of just on the upper lip that connects to the nose.  If I pop or scrape the blisters it will just scab up, and I think that takes even longer to heal -- however a scab is not quite as gross as a sore -- but may be more visiable.

Actually last saterday I went to the doctor for my foot.  He said I have tendonitius, and I went in kinda expecting them to say it was broken.  It is a really sharp pain on the blade (where the pinky toe bone has a joint) and according to him it is a insertion point for a tendon.  Very strange injury though.  There was never any swelling, and it only hurts after I have been moving for a few min, if I have been lying or sitting for a while I cna walk around for a min or two will little or no pain.  But when it kicks in it is an extremly sharp pain.  Not a big fan.

Oh, did I mention our trip to china was canceled?  Sucks like crazy.  We had to have 10 people to make the trip, but Glenn dropped out because Philip and Tom couldnt go.  Actually I was glad it got canceled.  I did not wanna go with out the guys going as well.  It would have sucked to be stuck with noone other than coach pei or suzie to talk to.  Maybe it would have helped repair things, but I kinda feel like that is not worth the effort to repair.  Plus I was ognly gonna be able to go for the second two weeks -- and the last week was not suposed to contain any real training, but be mostly trouristy stuff.  I could pretty much care less about that right now.  if I go I wanna go to train.  I need to get better and get my credentials better so I can teach later.  Hella annoying that the trip got canceled on my for the second year in a row.  I Am beginning to think I may want to find another way of going to china.   I know QDX said he would help me out, by hooking me up with friends or family of his over there -- so I may try to do that.  Perhaps I can tag along with another wushu school that goes to train.  Hey, if I do that I am sure I will make lots of new friends, that would be great fun.

This summer however I am determined to give kelly the vacation that she wants.  When I was still going to china she would get all worried that we were never going to go ona real vacation.  I admit I don't really care about them.  I mean, sure they would be fun, but they are expensive and get you nowhere.  I guess they are good stress releaf, but that is one of those things that I think you should be able to do on your own, in every day life.  I would much prefer to spend the money on otherthings -- the type of stuff that will get me where I want to be.  Either help me create or help my acheive my career goals.  You never heard of great things people have done by taking alot of cookie cutter corprate package vacations.  All of those type of things seem pretty silly for some reason. Worst thing is they are fake adventures.  You can't consider them as real adventures if everyone else in the country does it.  I would much more perfer something that you can tell a good story for (one of the criteria of an adventure) and have it push you a little to accomplish something.

All that said, there is one aspect to them that is all improtant.  I want my wife to be happy.  If she wants to go to one of those things, then I will take her.  I never said they would not be fun -- and I will have fun if she wants use to go.  If it were just be I would not waste my money on it, but it is not just me.  And with the new factors in it, I don't consider it a waste of money.  I hope kelly understands how much I want to do the vacation thing for her.  And I know tha the is honestly upset and worried that we won't ever take real vacations. I mean, I plan on taking trips with her well into our old age, but I think I need to prove that we will take trips in the first place.  So I will do that, and she will be happy the entire time (if I have any say to it).

Time to go find neosporin and apply it to my nose.  stinking sore.]]></content:encoded>

Long time no type.  Things are pretty much the same around here.  Work is kinda overwhelming, and I am responding by avoiding it.  That tends to make it more overwhelming  -- which results in me avoiding it more.  Everonce in a while I break down and do alot all at once.  If I would just break down and do it sooner it would be much less stressful.  Heh, go figure.  I gotta improve my work habbits/ethics.

Coach Pei recently bought a new car.  A crazy new car.  A crazy expensive new car.  Yep, he got a Benz s600.  Them cars start around $115.8K.  That's more than alot of houses.  Insane.  So coach is being all sketchy and missing all these classes to go to meetings.  I think it is with Miss lily, mostly be cause Peter said that Coach Pei would not want his name mnetioned with hers.  Before that it was merely my and Alex speculating about it.  All I cna do is watch, sence none will talk to me about that stuff, because I am out of the loop and all.  Damn, I gotta learn to care about that less.

I guess I should get a kick out of Coach Zhang begging Melinie to bring Paulo in to fix the computers, but I just wish they would ask me to help.  Sigh.  Oh well.

I think I am gonna teach chinese school next year.  My kids just seemed concerned at the thought of not having it, I broke down and have to return.  I really like them, even the annoying ones.  And some of them are really annoying.  Plus I talked to the principal about taking a chinese lantuage class in exchange for my teaching.  She seemed keen on the idea -- plus the class would run fomr 2-4, and my class starts at 4.  How great is that!

And after Chinese school, I cam back and we had Peter and Taiji Mike over to watch the simpsons.  Well, they went to see starwars at 6:30 -- so we taped it and were gonna watch it when they came over.  While I was moving the VCR downstairs KElly ordered pizza for us all.  Mike even insisted that he get a all veggie pizza.  Well, we hooked up the VCR and found out that we didnt get but the last 5 min of the simpsons.  After a few min of my trying ot entertain them with DVDs mike decided he wanted to leave.  Peter was his ride.  So peter being the uber polite person he is didnt say anything.  I was so pissed.  He insisted on his kinda pizza and then stuck us with them.  I even said he should wait for the pizza, but he said they would make good leftovers.  That bitch. I had been going otu of my way to see peter.  Kelly and I don't ever get to hang with him anymore.  About the only time I talk to him is online during the day.  At USWA he teaches the entire time -- from before I can show up till into my class (which he used to attend, but dosent because he teaches).  Back during the falling out I said to him that I was afraid of loosing him as a friend. He said non of the crap would make him not be my friend. I didnt mean that I thought he would get mad and un-friend me, but rather we would grow apart and never see each other.  That was my major concern for leaving USWA.  Paulo never shows up.  Melinie is pretty rare.  Even Keye, coaches new pet, is pretty scarce.  Philip only shows on friday with school and all -- I am having fewer and fewer reasons to stay.  At least coach Z is teaching me.  Damit.  it alwasy comes back to that.  I think abou tit way to much.  and in the paragraph I was suposed to just be raggin on Mike.  That Jerk.  Grrrr.

Looks like we are gonna be filming this weekend.  WE have everyone lined up and are gonna show at my place on saterday morning.  Weather Chanel is not calling for rain, we have all the players we need.  Disk is under way.

Here is the old script (this has and will change):

	DiskZG

	Opens:

	Establishing shot of apt building at night.

	Upstairs in the loft surrounded by computer parts.

	Hacker is on the phone. Hacker ejects the DVD and throw it into a jewel case. Hacker tells the person that he has it and will be right over. Runs down the stairs and out the door.

	Out side he runs down the stairs and almost gets to his car. Two people pull up and he mumbles "they found me". A couple of guys dressed in black jump out of the other car.

	Minion: Sir it appears you have something that belongs to us.
	Hacker: &#91;unlocking car door&#93; I don't know what you are talking about.
	Minion: give us the Disk, Sir.

	Minion slams the partially open car door before Hacker can get into the car. Minion Grabs his arm, which Hacker twists pretty easily out of. A few quick grabs at the disk in his hands and Hacker Turns to run, another minion steps out from behind a car cutting him off. Hacker Stuffs the disk down his pants and try to make a run for it. Jumping over the next car. The minions catch up and after a quick skirmish knock him out.

	Minion: Thug get the disk.
	Thug: Dude, I aint going after that
	Minion: Well Neither am I.
	Thug: if we don't get that Disk Eisner is gonna be pissed
	Minion: Then we take everything, you get the feet

	The Minions throw Hacker in the trunk. You see the car drive off, a few moving shots of the car from another car and a few of it driving by on the streets. Cut to inside the trunk. Hear the car doors slam, and a gasp. Some rumbling around and kicking. With night vision we can see Hacker has his mouth duct taped shut. So the appropriate murmuring sounds. Outside the car you can see it shaking and year the yelling.

	Voice over starts.
	Narrator: Well I am gonna be in there till morning, so I guess I otta fill you in on how I got here. It started when Zero Gravity went big time, getting big money form the Hollywood types. Money was so big they couldn't see the term of the contract they signed. Those Hollywood types took control - None of them had any power to fight the Evil Eisner. They had no choice, acting against Eisner was suicide. They had to stop sharing their movies with everybody on the net, would charge large fees for people to come see private showings in expensive hotels. The rest of us indie action filmmakers had nothing. (cut to fake ZG message board, talking about how cool the new movie is, bitching about Eisner) I knew that they had a new short up on their server but could not share with the rest of us. So until I get a name with ZG on the end I can't play along. I decided to take things into my own hands. I would get that movie. (cut to scene of Hacker "hacking" onto the server -- fake FTP/ssh/script kiddie web page and all) It was pretty easy - Script Kiddies could have gotten in without scripts. (cut to disk burning, phone call and Hacker running out side) Well I burned that film and was heading out to a fellow tricksters house to watch it and practice some moves...You know what happened then.

	Daytime shot of outside the car. The Minions come back talking on the phone...

	Minion: Yes Sir, we have the disk, no, it's in my trunk. Of course Sir, we will bring it right over. Dude, go check on the disk
	Thug: aighty

	Thug walks over to the car and you see him get kicked in the face with both legs (shot from in front of the car - all you see is trunk lid and Thug getting kicked)

	Hacker Jumps out, hands tied, tape over his mouth. Minion runs over and a quick skirmish with Hacker only using his legs and jumping over stuff. Minion helps Thug up and they go running after Hacker, who frees his hands on something that can cut duct tape. Rips the tape off his mouth and screams like it hurts. The minions hear that and come running.

	Insert Good fight scene here!

	Hacker swipes their car and heads off to a friends house.

	Shot of Hacker knocking on the door, they do in and pop in the DVD, it plays, but it is DAMN.

	Shot of Hacker and friend saying "Damn!"

Here is the message board conversation we were having about it:

	--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	OK, we need to work out some stuff for shooting Disk.

	Mostly times and loactions. I will go through and story board the rest of the film this week. I kinda need to decide on a good urban loaction we can film at, where we won't have security guard problems and would look like it could be the outside of a evil hollywood corporation hit man hideout ... parking grage woudl be great but security would be a hastle.

	When are you guys free? we need both the night shot and the day shot. the day one will prolly take 2 days. I think we can knock out the night in one couple-a-few hour session.

	As far as choreo we will do it during filming. For this project I am pushing to keep it small but force the extra time and effort into quality. I can scan the storyboard and upload the script to the web page if you want it.

	The ball is rolling don't let it stop

	--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Hey what fighting style should we do for the Disk? I don't think we should do wushu style because of the story of the movie. We should try more of an action type especially for the day shoot with 1 vs 2 people. I have some ideas about that. Let me know what you think.

	--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Think about the who am I roof scene. That is a similar flavor to what I intend disk to be.

	with that tender sweet and sour chinese flavor vs. the two skilled thugs.

	Hey guys. I think that the thugs should wear black suits. I'm thinking we can get some cheap wear at a thift shop. What do you think?

	--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	If the bad guys are going to wear black suits, we'll have to make sure we're not going to be rolling on the ground. Unless someone is paying for a budget of wardrobe, this is coming out of my working clothes closet.

	Now that I think of it, I only dark gray suits.

	--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Actually, I really like the idea of either dark suits or long dark jackets. I guess we can get away with out using actual suits, but dark pants and a button down shirt and tie. We otta make a run to goodwill and pick stuff up there. I am certian we can find good thug clothes there. I just wanna make sure we fit the look we need for convincing hitmen.

	Perhaps we can make a run this week? Thursday perhaps? Anyone know where goodwill or salvation army is?

	I will be willing to pay for the clothes, no problem. It's my movie, I otta pay.

	--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Great! the trendh coats would fit right. do you have black/dark grey jeans or other tuff pants? Plus how much do you like that coat...I mean if you are gonna be rolling around on asphalt you prolly shouldnt be too attached.

	I ahve a black trench coat, but I think I would rather see if I can find an alternitave because it is pretty nice. If we can't get suits for the thugs, we otta have them wear black pants and plain black shirts. however I like the idea of button down shirts -- kinda sells the part a bit more....

	Do you guys want to stop in a thrift shop on the way when we shoot? I think on sundays these shops might be closed. Definitely closed Monday. Do you still want to shoot on Saturday. We can try even if the weather is bad if we can find a covered parking garage....

	Alrighty, Looks like we are go for Saterday Morning. Weather Chanel is not calling for rain anymore on saterday or sunday. So I figure we can get this shot in those two days. That way we all still have monday free and this film stuff dosent "ruin" your entire weekend.

	Lets plan on leaving my place 11 on saterday morning to go to the location. I know of a few places we can shoot at. One would be a school right down the street -- I will go scouting tonight when I go the the thrift stores/goodwill places for wardrobe.

	I think my place is a good spot to meet because it is central to everyone and we all know how to get there. Speaking of everyone, that includes Me, Duanne, Dmitry, Beej and maybe Paulo. Paulo, you have to go help the Changs Haul stuff on saterday?

	My current plan is to shoot the daytime during the day on saterday and sunday. If we are up for it then we can shoot the night sequence this weekend as well. It might be easier to shoot that during a weekday, but if we have the oppertunity to get it done -- lets do it.

	Let me know if this is all cool or not. Lets get this movie done so someone else can make theirs (so I can get a break from being bossy).

	Chris

Needless to say I am quite excited about it.  We have added Duanne to the Peking Duck Group, and he is all up for doign artwork and filming.  I guess the fact that he is a former member of ZG helps.  Kinda reminds me of gerald.  Ok, reminds me alot of gerald.  Espically in the way he moves and acts.  Has a similar way of dodging criticism.  But that boy can draw.  He's amazing.  Dmitry is espically psyced that he is on our team now.  He was kinda the spark that got us on fire again.  I have recently redone the Peking Duck Site, added that messageboard, and revanped the entire look.  I guess most of that happend before duanne, but with his help we are really rolling along.

The best part is that Beej says he is gonna come out and and help film.  Gonna stick him on camera.  That is gonna help so much.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I will need to go back and fill you in on the state of the movie.  It is really making progress.  Wish I could indlude the video clips from it in here.

Anyway.

USWA is stagnet.  The coaches are not showign any signs of change and my contract there is running out.  I had planned to renew and pay it all up front so that I could show I am the bigger man and loyal to those I train with.  But I started thinking about it and began to think that is not such a good idea.  I mean I was so close to beign kicked out and things really havent changed from then.  I think I am gonna leave.  I feel dirty for wanting to go to O-Mei, but that is prolly because I have been conditioned to think that way.

Kelly is surprising me.  My contrack it up on the 17 of July - in a week or two.  Hers however runs till January.  She wants to stay.  I really hope she can do it.  I mean, not even stay the entire time, but just long enough to test for Sword and learn Chang Quan.  Plus she will help keep us in touch with all our friends we have there.  Needless to say I am very impressed with my Wife.  I didn't expect that at all -- after all those times the coaches have made her cry in class too.  She amazes me.

So I think I am gonna do it.  I am gonna go to that other school.  I am gonna be called a trator at USWA.  Man, I loved that place.  I hate to think of it that way.  But if the coaches are the type of people that will talk about me behind my back why should I continue to support them.  I mean I want to make Wushu my life, and my wushu coach is a major part of my future carrer.  I understand that coach pei will not talk to me because he will not associate with people who he does not approve of.  I am thinking I don't want to associate with people that refuse to forgive.  Or insist on a first strike your out policy.  He should be flattered that I woudl leave his school because I don't want to associate with him, in a way you could say I learned it from him.  I learned alot of really good things from that man -- ways to act in the martial arts world, policies to enforce, teachign techniques.  But in the past few months I have also been given a lesson on what not to do.  I remember in Febuary the coaches were telling me that they treat everyone equal.  Now they have a new theory, the inner circle policy.  If you are in their inner circle (ie. are currently doign them favors) then they will help you.  If not you are second on the list.

The Circle.

Coach Z has even been point blank and said to Philip and Glenn that if they stay in the circle she will help them more (as in teach more).  She has even gotten into the habbit of saying who is in and who is out of the circle.   I am out, way out.  Glenn even needed help with a demo and listed me as a possibility, but coach told him he can't use me.  Man.  I am gonna miss training with those people.  I don't wanna go, but I think I will be miseriable if I stay.  Getting by on the bare minum that the coaches feel obligated to give me (and they are by far the most expensive school in town).  I simply refuse to submit my self to the authority of such hypocritical people. I still love them, and I hope they could one day find it to forgive me for the things they think I have done agenst them.  but I was only trying to help.  If I had other motives I would have left along time ago. I hope some how they will know that.

You know what I am wrried about when I wrote those last few sentences.  That people would not buy it, say it sounds like I am the floofy/wishy-washy/preach-the-big-stuff-but-act-diffrent kinda guy.  That I will claim I am only trying to help but hav emy own motives.  I mean I know the times when I was that way (like when suzie said I was trying to make her look bad, and I responded with "oh no, I never would do that"  that was not true.  I was mad at her, and wanted others to be too.  Still, I wish we could be friends again)  I mean I guess I shouldnt worry about that.  People are not suposed to be reading this in the first place.  So you better stop reading and forget everything I already told you!

Well I am determined to show the coaches what the missed out on.  I am going to get good.  I want to be one of the best, I don't know how.  but I am gonna go for it.  I know there are many more people with natural talent much higer than mine, but I am not gonna let that stop me.  They want one thing, to have good students to show off, I am determined to get good enought that they have to tell their friends that I am that good bacause of them, dispite what they really know.

Lets move on.  I could type about them all day.  and I really shoudl stop dwelling on the situation at USWA.  Soon I will be wearing Black and Yellow.  *gasp*

We reshot the school scene this last weekend.  It was fun.  We had Beej out for his second shooting with us.  I dont' know if I prefer Beej to Paulo filming or not.  Paulo has better ideas for what motion is good, but beej seems to shoot better quality (however less imagnative) footage.

The school fight scene is the final fight in disk (working title).  So we were determined to make it good.  We shot it once on the first weekend we filmed, but that was after a few hourse behind the golds gym for the alley scene.  It lacked the flavor we wanted -- so we started over.  Now it has a bit more jackie chan style to it. The Tie Fight scene was great, I just hope it edits together well.

The Butterfly twist fall...I was pratcint it for a good two weeks getting ready.  most of the takes didnt hurt at all, but the good shots brused pretty good.  We had one nice take -- was planning to use it inthe final for sure -- and it got taped over!  man I was so mad.  I went back right away and reshot it with Duanne and Glenn, you can tell the lighting is diffrent, but I am gonna try to cover that up in editing.  I don't think the shadows will be that noticable.  In addition we are gonna hve to go back in a week or two to get a few transistions that we missed.  Nothing major, should be really quick.

Well this weekend was pretty fun, we filmed on saterday, and went into DC on sunday for the Silk Road Festival.  That was really quite cool, Sean Glenn and I even found Rene down there.  Gotta see some cool Chinese Opera and I got a few Au Batido Pictures in DC.  The crappy thing was Kelly being out of town.  She had to fly to TX at the last min because her grandfather died.  She was pretty stressed about it I think.

I could tell that the biggest problem she was having with her Grandfather passing away was the fact that she had been mad at him for the way he treated her grandmother.  I know she didn't get much time there to morn him, and I know her family dosent want to talk about it.  I don't blame them really, I know when Grandpa John Died I just wanted to pretend he was still here, and everything was fine.  I still don't feel like he is gone.  I guess it is better that way -- for me.

It does seem like kelly needs to vent about it, needs people who will talk to her and be sad with her.  I never really knew her grandfather so I don't think I am that person.  I will play the part as much as I can, but I don't think it is gonna be exactly what she needs.  Really it would help if her father would just stop being so pissed off and get out of a foul mood and talk to her.  Silly man.  Silly Wife.  Silly me.

We are gonna go to richmond for the 4th.  I need it.  I need to be around family, I feel like richmond is home, DC is a camp or something.  I have friends there that will love me even if I wrong them.  And real live full fledged family.  I want to move back -- however I like it up here.  I guess mostly for the training and the projects (like PDP) I can do up here.

Everett and Jason both have women.  this is a good thing.  I think Everet real has it for this girl, and Jason seems quite serious.  I think kelly would get along with them wonderfully.  However I do the know the night before we left Everett and his woman Sarah had a little spat -- and somehow got jason involved.  I hope that is blows over and thing are good when we go down this week.  I am desprate for avoiding a soap opera in richmond...

Ahh, back to work.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Tuesday, August 13, 2002

It's been a while again.  Figured I otta let you know what i going on.  It is official I have left USWA, I now go to O-Mei.  It is better.  Randomly awkward when I am hanging around or talking to old friends there -- But most of them support my choice and I get to see them pretty often.  I am not worried about loosing contact with Glenn or Sean or Paulanie.  Peter worries me a bit, perhaps when the school year starts he will chat online with me again.  But right now I am getting very little feed back.  He is actually being very friendly, but only in extremely short bursts.  Then he seems to go away, normally to wait on Zhang gui Feng or Chris Pei.  This last weekend was capitol classics (QDX and Tina where here, YAY!) and he made a good showing there as a Judge (dressed up in a suit just like Pei would have him be), when we wasnt doing that he was waiting on Zhang hand in foot.  Numrous "Coach's Bitch" comments.  It reallys sucks to see one of my best friends slipping away from me.  I even told him it was gonna happen.  Sigh.

A funny twist seems be be occuring with Suzie.  From the sound of it she is pretty much quitting her job as Zhang's Bitch. She told the coaches that she does not want to teach anymore.  That'll get her kicked out of the circle pretty quick -- from the roumors I have heard she has not even shown up to class for about a month.  I didnt see that coming.  Plus at dinner the final day Kelly and I went to USWA suzie was being all nice.  That was cool.

With the Capitol Classics in town we also had QDX show up here.  It was great, Kelly and I ran to the airport and stole them away for the first night which was wonderful fun.  Plus we hung out with them for pretty much the entire weekend.  Philip had to go pay dues during dinner on saterday because QDX, Me and Sarah were not about to go eat with her -- but he kinda had to go.  I was so much happier to eat with them.  They are people I could offend but apologize and they would let me back.

I was able to take a seminar taht QDX tought.  He was trying to get me to not take it, thinking it was a waste of money for me -- but I got it.  I mostly wanted to take it so I could support him and help him out.  And once he finished making fun of me for learning sword he actually tought me alot.  Sarah was on had to help with a few of the details.  She is the one that is actually teaching me sword at OMei.  Kinda cool, actually, she has great flavor and I think I am learning it pretty fast.  Still it feels amazingly awkward -- that 2 finger thing  you do with the empty hand really seems retarted when I am doing it.  Guess it always looked cool for other people so I won't worry too much.  Lu Xiao Ling (the OMei head coach) has also been a help, even offered to work with me before class if I show up early.  I am planning on showing up early today.

Sean and I have been hanging around each other more these days.  This is a direct result of our mutual intrest in Go.  I love that game.  I found out is it considered a martial art in most of asia and I was sold.  I always liked chess, but always really sucked at it.  This game is like chess backwards, you dont' win by killing the king, but you gotta get as much lad as possable -- it starts out all simple and gets complicated.  Unlike chess that is the other way around.  Plus with the Hikaru Go Go Manga I have been reading I am all sorts of sold on it.  We are planning on going to a Go club -- well, a weiqi club this sunday to check things out.  The one we found is nice because it is at a chinese binlingual institute.  So we will also get plenty of chinese pratice.  YAY!  I also play online when I get a chance to -- unfortunally it also tends to take away from my video editing time.  I really got to get Transfer Complete, um...complete.

Everett came up a couple of weeks ago and se spent the entire saterday making music for that movie.  Now I am gonna finish the music on my own and do all the sound effects.  So many people want it done yesterday, so few people are willing to do the work to help get it done.  Thank God I was able to learn the stuff everett was doing.  He is pretty good at that acid program, but I think i got a handle on it for the time being.  Sound effects take so long to put in -- but I know I can do it well if I put the time into it.  Just gotta find the time.

Well, I really havnt done much for the past 2 days here so I otta go do work stuff.  the last few weeks I had been cranking out quite a bit of work, but now there is a lul and I lack motivation to do actual work work.  I wish I could pratice wushu/go/film stuff here instead....aiya.  Stupid work, it takes up so much time.  Why can't my projects be my work instead and then I would be able to do them better and have more time.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Well it's the 21st of October and the Washington DC Sniper has been running around sense the 2nd.  Things are seeming crazy, but I think I have started to get used to it.  Kelly is very high strung and reads the Word and prays every night in order to get to sleep.  At first she was ok, but after 4 or five deaths she started to really worry.  I beleave her when she says she is more scared of me getting shot than her death.  This weekend Nikki was suposed to com visit from Radford, but my parents didn't want her to come up with all the shootings -- instead they wanted her go go visit them, and guess where the next shooting was?  Richmond.  Well, just north of Richmond, in Ashland VA. This is all too scary.

Moving on to more happy stuff.  I had my first chinese test and I wound up with a 96, I was pretty happy -- but I really was trying to ace the test.  I studied for a good 2 weeks for it.  But Chinese School is going well.  My Wushu class is sorta dwindling -- my kids are loosing intrest, but I seem to have a pretty good group.  Most are either 6 or 7 years old, but I have a few that are older.  The older ones are wonderful.  I guess when you have been dealing with kids who really cannot stand on one spot and pay attention the moment when you have someone remember the form from week to week it is always gonna seem wonderful.  I wish I chould get some of the older kids, like teenaged ones, but once they walk in and see all the 6 year olds they split.  Oh well, in a few years my kids will be teenagers.

Kelly and I are getting a little discuraged about our friends.  It really seems like we are bugging those that are still close to us and all the others are just moving on and forgetting that we exist.  I feel like if I just didn't call anyone -- and waited for them to call me -- that i would only get calls form my parents.  I know sean would call, so he is an exception.  But kelly feels that she is even being a burden to Jeannie.  I understand jeannie is busy, but I really wish she would call kelly more.  I mean, I know she is not the calling type, and kelly is, however I am searching for some reassurance that kelly (and me) are not just annoying to her.  We have been trying to seem paulo and mel for a while, and that is just getting harder and harder.  I am convinced that if I stoped pushing to see them that I would never see them again.  Same with peter.  He was like my best friend for a while there.  I really dont' want him to drop out of my life, but I feel that he would look at the situation and decide that I am not a priority and while he would not do any thing directly to hurt me we will simply never see each other again.  That really sucks.  I miss peter quite a bit.  But I honestly think he would never call me to go do anything.  I hope I am wrong.  It was the weekend before last (I think) and I called him to grap dinner or the like, and he said he would rather go home and read for the afternoon/night.  I was very offended, of course I said that was fine, but deep down it really hurt.  I mean, he was gonna go read star wars novels, the romance smut novel of the geeks.  Back before I left USWA, he responded to my fear of loosign him as a friend by saying he would stay my friend.  I didn't mean he would decide to be unfriendly, but that we would never be able to see each other again.  Dammit, if I knew I was gonna loose peter this easy I might have stayed.  I miss hanging out with him.  I know kelly does too.  STAR WARS novels.  Geez.  Oh, I sent him like 3 emails trying to get him to come ot KElly's Birthday party, and I know that it was during the week and he prolly had class, but he didn't call or respond or anything.  Perhaps he is the one that tipped zhang gui feng off to her party.  (ZGF asked glenn about kelly's birthday party).

While I am ranting about friends that never call me (I guess it would be mroe polite to say: that I have to call if I ever want to see again) Beej has gotten engaged to katie.  Which I think is good, she actually proposed to him.  So she redeemed herself from turning him down a few times in the past.  Now if I could only do something to convince him that I am worth hanging out with.  I think katie dosent think too highly of me.  This is depressing.

Oh, in exciting news I have applied to Cirque du Soleil.  It is for a martialarts posistion in a permanent show in Las Vegas.  I spent a while and made a demo video and some pictures and sent off an application package.  I really feel like I am way out of my league with those people, but I am hopeful that I will get a responce.  So I will cross my fingers and pray.  Pray and train hard -- as if I had an audition on the way.  This would be a dream come true in so many ways.

Alrighty, I am off to figure out ways to convince people that they want to hang around me bad enough that they would call me.  but I need to do it with out pestering them.  hmrm.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[November 1, 2002.

Turns out alot of my concerns from my lst entry were subduded in the few days following. We got calls from a number for people.  I still have not heard form peter, but the gonzagas calld us -- and so did glenn and tom and a few more.  That was really nice.  We have missed each other in passing a few times but there was at least some effort put out to try to see everyone.  Beej and Katie are even suposed to come over and watch the VT football game this weekend.

Tonight Kelly is gonna jump on the metro and come out to Alexandria to see a movie.  We are gonna meet up with Josh and see iSpy. or is it I Spy.  ionno.  iSpy just has a cool mac sound to it.

My shins are acting up, and I have a new drive to get my tornado kicks to a higher level.  That really sucks when you wanna train so bad, but it only makes you hurt more.  My tonados are better these days, but I feel like my front jump snap kicks are getting low and sloppy. I really need to drill them.  But I also really need my shins to be in good condition when I go to china.

Right now the plan is to still go in Febuary.  Everyone keeps telling me how cold it is gonna be, but at this point it is cold china or the chance of no china.  Everything is setup.  I need to send the program payment to Morgan Li this month, and still gotta get my Visa and Plane ticket, but the travel agency told me I was in no hurry because the prices are not gonna change too much in the next few months.  Apperenly no one goes to china in Febuary.  Hmmmm, maybe there is a reason for that.

I just go the t-shirts and stickers I made for Peking Duck form cafe press.  They are pretty nice, I hope they will last for a while but I am happy with what they look like.  I love the Duck head logo, but Duanne's Ducktacon looks pretty sweet on a shirt.  No telling when we will make the next movie.  I hope it won't be too long, but I do really need to get started on the DVD.  I need that ready by Christmas because it is our planned present to 50% of the people we know.  I have to start doign research for the menus. Guess I will have to watch a bunch of DVD's so I can look at their menus.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[November 6, 2002.

Man, I get sick WAY to often.  This is really annoying.  I have been coughing up some of the nastyest dark yellow opaque bitter flem you have ever seen.  On my drive in today I swear I snorted somthing into my mouth that was the size of a golfball.  Of course it wasnt, but it was at least that nasty.  I miss working out. Lastnight I missed sword class and gymnastics.  Tuesdays are normally the most fun, sword class is pretty easy physically sence I still don't know the form and gymnastics is just a flipping good time.  You know I really think sword is the easiest form to do physically.  I don't know if I will ever be able to do it and make it look good, but it dosent wear me out like the other forms.  Or I am not good enought at it yet to wear my self out.  Either way it makes for a fun class.

I am seriously debating exporting this journal out to a blog.  xanga.com has a nice interface, but I worry about puttint it all up there.  What if they sell off their content or it just up and goes away.  I think I will stick to this format for a while.  Not as nice of an interface but it is nice to have it backed up in a few places for safe keeping.  Work, home and the Apple iDisk.  That is pretty safe I think.

Not too much going on.  I am iching to go workout.  I really wanna train wushu and get better.  I must get the roundoff-backhandspring(s)-backtuck thing down.  I want it so bad I can taste it.  Must do a full twist.  Must have a good sword form.  These things seem so far off but I am determined to get them.

I keep telling kelly I want to go on an adventure.  I don't think she knows exactly what I mean.  Mostly I would like to move to china for a year or so.  I don't know exactly what I would do, probably teach english to the locals.  If I could do that and study wushu while I was there it would be wonderful.  Unfortunally I don't know how the wushu school thing works in china.  I know the best wushu comes from the local teams, but I dont' think I would be earning the money needed to pay for lessons with them.  I dont know, maybe I would.  Perhaps I could just go find some old master and he would hook me up.  I think I would prefer to go to Beijing and study at BUPE, but I dont beleave I can convince my wife that it is worth 2 years of our life for me to go get a degree in wushu from there.  However, I think I could come back to the states and open a school right away after that.  Man, this is one of those topics that you think about and really want, but don't ever want to talk about because you are scared they will get shot down.  I get nervous thinking about it.  As if thinking about it will get me committed to the idea only to have it shot down fast.

Other than studying wushu, I really have a strong desire to speak chinese.  It is another one of those things that just is overwhelming these days.  If I wasnt married I would go to china once my lease is up.  But I am married, and would not have it anyother way.  I find it all so very intreguing.  From their philosophy to architecture to martial arts.  It's wierd how the chinese teachings inforce the same principals as the Word of God.  So many similarities.

Well, I guess taking my trip to china in febuary, when it is cold and no one likes to visit will be good.  I need to go and see what it is like, and this way I will get to see it at it's worst.  If I still want to go for longer after that I will have more information at my disposal.

...

Aiya, I got distracetd there for a while.  Now it is time to go home.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[November 14, 2002.

Well I am feeling much better.  Kelly took me to the urgend care center on Sunday because I was not feeling better.   I was convinced it was a sinus infection. The doctor seemed to agree, and she gave me Zithromax.  My flem wnet from dark yellow to clear in 24 hours!  I finally finished that percription today, and I am feeling much better.  Unfortunally Kelly has now come down with the same thing.  Her Doc said it was a viral laryngitis.  But she got antibiotics that she could go get if she didn't feel better in a few days.  Well she didn't, so she started taking them last night.  Hopefully she will get better soon.  She has been talking like a frog, and now her ears and throat have been hurting more.  Poor girl.

Oh, you know the other really wierd thing, her temperture was 92 degrees.  Isn't that insane?  I didn't know what that means, I mean, it's nto a cold, it's like she's running a colder or something.  The nurse and doctor didn't seem to think it was very strange.  But I sure do.  I guess she wasn't kidding all those time when she was fussing about being cold.

I talked to Jason last night on the phone.  I was working pretty late and he called my cell phone.  After trying for a wile to talk in my cube I finaly wondered outside into the cold where I got a good reception.  Apperently he is flying to costa rica for a week and a half to see his woman.  Very cool.  So he is gonna crash at our place before he leaves.  Crazy thing is it is the same day I am getting wisdom teeth surgery, but his flight leaves a few hours before my appointment.  Only bad thing about this arrangement is I am gonna want to eat then -- but I have to go 6 hours with no food or drink.

Man.  I am a little worried about my wisdom teeth extraction -- the dentist I went to really scared me.  However this oral surgon was very confident and seem to know what he was talking about.  He gave me little reason for concern.  I talked to my parents last night and my Mom was trying to talk it down.  it almost made it worse, like she was trying to talk me into it not being bad.  Plus she was the one insisting that I wait it out for the teeth to come out and now they are impacted.  I really wish we could have done this 6 years ago when the dentist was telling me to get it done.

I don't know fi I mentioned it before, but Jimmy had bought Mr. Wolf's old wileys jeep, not now he is married and dosent want it anymore, so my father and jason took it to grandpa john's farm and put it in the barn.  Well it was kinda being kept there and jimmy wanted $1200 for it.  However I dont' really have that sorta cash right now for another toy that would require alot of work and money to get in working order.  So I told Jason my woes about spending alot of money on my Jeep for reoutene maintanance and brakes -- it was over a thousand dollars in work these last two months.  Pretty annoying.  Anyway, I told them that if jimmy can sell it that he should go ahead and do so.  I don't want to get into the thing where I pay him in installments.  Not gonna have another fiasco like I had with Everett.

I think I told you about how I sold Everett Kelly's old Civic.  Well I offered to sell it to him for $1000.  He talked me up to $1200.  I meand blue book was a good $3500.  He told me he would pay me in a week.  I said deal. He then said he would pay in two installments of $600.  Ugh.  So in a week I went to meet him and he forgot the checks.  Damn.  You know what?  I could spell this out in vivid detail, but I will just include the emails discussion we had, it should be pretty clear:

TODO: Cut 'n Past the emails!!!!

On a happy note, it looks like my friend from Kansas is coming for a visit.  I have never actually met Dean, only chated with him online for some time now, over a year I think.  He trains with a former professional wushu lady out there in Kansas City, Shao Li.  I also helped out with some of the logo stuff for the school and we talk wushu all the time.  I guess he has some vacation days so he is flying in to DC for the weekend.  I am gonna take him to O-Mei for a couple of classes, probably the friday class and the saterday class.  He will be here the weekend of December 7th and 8th, so we will also be able to go out with some old USWA buddies for Glen and my birthday that night.  Overall I think it will be a good weekend.  He is flying into national around 2pm, so he is just down the street from my office and hopefully I will be able to take off early that day to go pick him up.  It's almost too bad he wants to go to O-Mei that night, we could hang around in Old Town an dhave a great old time.

In conclusion:  Ice both legs.  I iced the leg that felt the worst after wushu last night.  That leg hurts much less than the other one now.  so in the future do both.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[November 15, 2002

Dang I am sore today.  After a week off being sick I have gone and gotten all sore.  I didn't even go to Wushu last night, it was just a little bit of gymnastics.  Last night was a thursday night, My coach Carlos lets me come in and drill some stuff while he has a private lesson.  He is really cool about it, won't even let me pay him for it.  I have been drilling nothing by round off back handprings.  I am sure I could throw a back tuck on at the end there, but I havent tried that yet.  I wanna be my back handsprings super consistant and solid.

I found out that one of the guys form the power tumbling team is also trying out for Cirque.  He has already auditioned and made it to the final rounds before they told him to go away.  They later called him up to montreal to talk about some contract stuff -- he flew up there for a 15 min meeting, then the told him to go away.  Fun part is at the power tumbling world's he was approached by them a 3rd time.  So now he is debating going off and joing cirque (probably for the same show I am trying for) or waiting until after world's.  He is insane, national champion power tumbler.  Triple backs and alls sorts of triple twisting double backs and what not.  kid's got so much on me.  Hopefully they are looking for martial artist more.

I was reading little Alex's Blog recently.  I like that kid.  Too bad I never see him because of the fact he goes to USWA.  HE is getting good too.  Here is a little excerpt from his log:

<blockquote>	I was teaching Wushu today and in the next set of kids over, I saw this kid named Dennis. 15/ 16 years old doing his staff form. He was pretty damn fast, and thats when the thoughts hit me. I realized that he's faster than me or atleast soon will be. He's going to be better soon if I don't pick up. I had similar thoughts when I was pushing it in the advanced Wushu class when Andrew joined. It's not being number 2, its the feeling of being better and then slowly being overtaken. It's not like an upset victory because you see it coming.
	I can rationalize with things like I can jump higher and have better tricks, but when it comes down to it, I'm losing the edge.

	It is a shame that I never hit my peak and yet I am already deteriorating. I am tired of manning it out and waiting for a better tomorrow. I miss the days when I could just do it.

	Shame I know it's jealousy. Have you ever felt that you could have been better but missed it? The potential was there, but I missed it. I guess it goes for school too. I was always told that I was damn smart. If only I worked, I too could be applying for Harvard and have Ivy League dreams.
</blockquote>

Funny thing is I have felt the exact same way he does -- about him.  I look at waht I am doing and it seems like I havent made any big advances in a LONG time.  I mean, I was doign roundoff back handsprings and butterfly twists back in college, and now I am still working those.  I knwo I have imporoved the quality of the stuff I can do but there are other things that I am scared of doing that I used to.  Like that frikkin wall flip.

Well, with theis Cirque audition coming up I am gonna push so hard.  if I don't make any gains it won't be because I didn't try.  I am determined to get better.  I want to be competitive on a national level in wushu.  I have a ways to go, but I dont' think it is that far off.  I am tired of being good at the school level -- there are no regional levels for wushu, the next step is national.

Stupid shin splints.  And my calf's are insane-o-sore.  hammies are stale twizlers -- changquan class day before yesterday did that.  However I had a good class -- coach lu said I had good tornados there.  So happy to hear that.

Kelly is feeling better, but not quite back up to speed.  She is takign the day off to go to waldorf to see her old dentist.  She has to get that crown replaced.  Not too much fun.  Poor girl, I wish she would get her voice back.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Well, looks like I finally got this blog set up and working.  I am gonna use it full time for a while and see how I like it.  if things go well I can just abandon the text file I keep in my iDisk.

This weekend was very productive actually.  We went to Raleigh.  Drug Sean along, he used to live down there and wanted to go hang out in the bike shop he used to work for.  We wound up staying with gerald.  Met up with Johnny and Sarah for lunch on saterday, even got to meet Ethen.  Hung out with brandon saterday night.

It seemed like Sean was getting sicker as the weekend passed, I hope we didn't give him the viral thing we had.  That would really suck. But he was a great traveling companion, good conversationalist.  Plus we got to talk about china and all sorts of great things.

Johnny and Sara seemed good -- ethan was great.  We gook them to El Rodeo and fed Ethan a chip -- he promptly threw up all over the place.  it was great fun.  So nice to see johnny and sara again, we dont' see them nearly enough.  Both kelly and I would like to get closer to them as friends.  we wish we would have hung out with them in school more.

Gerald seemed good, his house was nice -- still pretty empty, but starting to fill out.  Kelly and I were jelous of it as usual.  Such the perfict size for a young couple.

We went to dinner at a nice brewery type place, pretty upscale.  Had good old fashoned N.C. style pulled pork.  Later we went back to Brandon's place and surfed the web and watched downloaded movie on his wall projection TV.  That was fun.  Watched a few Peking Duck movies that were life sized.

The drive back sucked.  It was raining pretty hard and was very dark.  PRetty stressful and long.  Stoped in richmond to say hi to my parents, and showed sean all the pets.  He seemed to love all the old bikes my parents had.  Plus I really needed the break in driving.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I took Kelly out nice last night.  And by nice I mean Arbys!  Actually she said she would have a meeting until 6. So I told her that I wanted to come and save her.  Making sure to be there well before 6, I woud up getting there about 5:40 or so.  I had planed to stop and get gas, but I pulled up to the pump at the gas king and found out that they didn't take credit card at the pump.  Pshhhh, I aint gonna walk all the way inside just to pay for my gas.  Anyway, I just kept on rolling and went to wait for kelly.  About quarter till 6 she calls me and asks where I am.  Apperently I left AIM running at the office so she thought I hadnt left yet.  Oops.  She came down and I wisked her off to Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.  A pretty good movie, but now I really wanna see Two Towers.

After the movie we came home and I caught the last part of "Ali" on HBO.  Man, everytime I watch a boxing movie I really wanna start running in the morning.  So when the morning came around -- and it was one of those days I kelly gets up crazy early to go to Richmond -- I hit snooze until 8:20 or so.  Damn.  My problem is I felt all extra rested once it was 8:30.  I don't think I would have been so anti-sleepy if I would have jumped up at 7:30 and ran around.  I seriously think that it will help my shin splints though.  Not to mention everything else.  Road work is crutial, stronger legs, stronger bones, better fitness level over all.  I gotta get some will power together.  And get a good hand stand.  But that is an entirely diffrent rant.

I was thinking I would wake up and go running, then hit early sword class, take a short hour break and take advanced sword class, only to sneak out in time to make it to gymnastics.  I don't know if I am gonna push for both wushu classes tonight.  Sword classes are not too hard on my body, so I think I might.  I know I will be skipping tomorrow night's Chang Quan class for Tom's student movie premiere.  However I intend on going friday and saterday.  At least Saterday.

Quick rant: I gotta lift more.  aiya.

I was able to hammer out some tricky parcing stuff at work by using java's lang.Strong.replace and .replaceAll functions.  Those little functions were gonna cost me some real time if I would have done it the full out parce proper way.  We will see if it holds up.  I think Kim is happier with me now, I hadn't talked to anyone here for a while, jsut would sit down and do my stuff. Or not do my stuff, and do my other own personal stuff -- I need to interact more.  When I am talking with people like kim and kevin they seem to be happier with me.

Hmmm, now that I think about it maybe I shouldn't bother talking about work here, I would rather come back to this and read about adventures with kelly and fun with training.  Yeah, that's a better idea.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Stupid Shins.  Man they are really getting painful again. I don't think they are as bad as they used to be, but it don't feel too happy.  I am pushing some of that jump training stuff I used to do for conditioning.  I did a bunch of front tucks in gymnastics last night.  Then Kyle and I got into a front tuck over stuff contest.  Which he schooled me on.  Plus that was really hurting my shins.  Still didn't tack on the back tuck after the round off back handspring.  I know I could do it, but I must get more consistent at the back handspring

I wanted to go to both wushu classes last night, but wound up missing the first one because I lost track of time here at work and didn't get out soon enough to get there.  But I went to the advanced sword class ' I am feeling better about my sword form now, but I can really feel the parts I suck at.  Getting to the point that I need to get video of me doing the form to see what I can fix.

Over all it was a pretty productive night.  No major gains, and I need to keep those coming if I am gonna get ready for my audition with cirque.

Important goals before cirque:
-Get round off back handspring back tuck
-Get Multi back handsprings
-Get butterfly - butterfly twist
-Get Butterfly twist with staff
-Get Butterfly twist split
-Get Tornado split
-Clean up my forms, learn to explode better.

I feel the explosion stuff happening in a few places, I need to copy that and run with it.  The more I learn to relax the better it is getting.  This is why I think sword is so helpful for my wushu right now.

Bryan Tangren seem to be interested in taking some Capoeira classes.  That would be fun.  Good for the dance part of the Audition.

In conclusion:  Watch good people more, see how they do it. And do that.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[We went to go see the screening of Tom's Student film last night.  'False Ascendants' or something like that.  It was shown at a little student film get together put on by a 'Fire wire' work shop at his school  It was pretty cool.  I thought the movie was the best on there.  There were only two other shorts made for the workshop, and we were forced to sit through a number of class projects that went on forever.  Some documentaries about olden printing or yore.  Ugh.

Seeing tom's movie was fun, and it was double fun seeing everyone again.  The big surprise was when Suzie showed.  She actually wound up sitting next to me ' apparently she has up and quit wushu for now and has taken up bass guitar.  So we talked about that for a while.  It was nice to see her again, esp. because she was not mad or bitter at me anymore.  That was a good to know.  Let's see, we had Greg and his girl, Paulo, Glen, Adrian, Trish, and a smattering of peeps I didn't know.

Kung Fu Action in his movie was pretty good. It was about on the same level as our older stuff.  Cameron and Adrian were in it ' and some other acrobatic kid with strange hair.  Makes me really wanna get going on some film stuff.  Got to finish this DVD first.  So much work to be done on that.  I will start to reedit remote this weekend, then I would like to make the time lapse short of my commute to work.  THEN if I have time I will do a bloopers from all of PDP stuff.  I don't think I will bother with any sorta directors commentary or the like.

OK, my shins are tender, but not so bad.  Now my thighs hurt.  Heh.  If it is not one thing it is another.  This is all because of the frog jumps Lu Jiao Lin had us do at the end of Tuesdays sword class.  You know what this tells me?  Do more frog jumps.  I think I will make it to staff class and gymnastics despite how hard it is to walk right now.

I swear I haven't seen Kelly all week.  I think she thinks so too, because earlier she said 'i don't think i've see n you this week!'.  I feel bad about running off to wushu and the gym, but at least she has plans to go to the gym and go get passport photos taken.  So at least she won't be sitting at home all sad.  I am thinking I will skip class on Friday so I can hang with her, and just hit up Saturday class extra hard.  Sounds like a plan.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I had the strangest dream last night.  I remember Kelly and I got stranded some tropical place, like an island.  We were running around for some reason, and we happened upon Master Phuong and Yatski.  They had their own private lagoon, so they invited us to go swimming.  Very strange.  But it gets even stranger, some how we were able to escape that and I would up being on the VT football team.  Not like I was suddenly a good football player or anything, but rather I was just like I am now, but I got to play a nationally televised game for some reason or another.  The main detail I remember is that they had these strange yellow white and red uniforms, and they put 'Anderson' on the back of mine.  I remember some pre-game practice where I was all nervous about catching the ball ' be cause the QB would throw it so hard.  There was some happenings during the game, they wanted to make me a wide receiver ' but I really wanted to try to tackle some one.  From what I can remember I was able to run the ball but just missed the touch down.  I was just happy I didn't fumble the ball.  After the game we went back to the locker room and complained about the jersey having the wrong name on it.  ANYWAY'

Last night I didn't make it to gymnastics, wushu ran late.  There is a girl there form Brazil. She actually has a job for the government teaching wushu.  She said that she currently goes to college, but after she graduates wants to open her own wushu school.  Very cool.  Needless to say she is pretty dang good.  I think she has been at O-Mei practicing all day all week for the past two weeks.  After class she thought us some Capoeira.  I think She as inspired by Jason's double leg. I was sorta discouraged by it.  I want a good double leg, especially after he did one over me.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[This weekend was pretty good.  I pulled both hamstrings in wushu during basics.  During Kick-Punch actually.  so it was right at the start of class.  Of course I finished class -- and now my legs are mad at me.  Stupid Stupid Stupid.  Oh well, only one wushu class this week because of thanksgiving.  Sunday I went to Chinese school ' it was horrible, we had a test that I had forgotten about, and I was supposed to write a dialogue.  That had slipped my mind.  I knew I didn't have any flashcards to make because I had done extra the past few weeks, and my sentences were up to date, but forgot the dialogue.  We went to Cheryl's birthday party after a quick nap after class.  IT was fun, but man, talk about an abundance of trendy Asians.  Kelly and I were the token white people for a while.  Which is find by me, but we were also the token non-trendy people and that was a little awkward.  Heh.

Speaking of thanksgiving ' I am a little annoyed at my parents right now.  Every time I talk to them they have been giving me this little guilt trip type thing.  Like we don't come down enough or call enough.  I am thoroughly annoyed.  Every thing they have been doing is pretty blatant guilt tripping ' like we are neglecting them.  But you know what?  It only pisses me off.  They tell my wife to call them 'Mr. And Mrs.' or "Sir'!  I really shouldn't get upset about it, but I am not going to go and change my plans or life around to appease them until they show interest in me for things other than computer help and show Kelly a little'no, a lot more respect.  Arrghhh!

Here is a little reply I wrote to something posted on Raffi's board about wushu and belt rank systems:

<blockquote>
I have some serious issues for belt ranking systems.    While from what I have seen many wushu schools tend to do a pretty good job in assigning rank I fear that they will slip down that same path that the other styles that have come before us.

 From my experience there is a lot of bad connotations with the Japanese based belt ranking system.   Too many people put too much emphasis on their rank.  How many times have you told someone that you study martial arts only to have them ask, 'Are you a black belt?' If you say no they kinda brush you off with an 'oh.'   I know just about all the kids I teach always come in with one question, they want to know what belt I am ' and I always insist that wushu doesn't have belts.  I am very proud of this fact, it keeps us free from the bad stigma of this type of ranking system; which allows people get judged more for their skill than their pants-holder-upper.

This is not limited to outsiders simply misunderstanding the internal workings of martial arts.  There are plenty of people that will look down upon those who easily surpass them in skill only because they have more stripes on their belt.  This leads to people convinced they are better simply because they have a high impressive sounding rank.  While sometimes it will push people to train harder because they have to uphold the image of the belt, others view it as a goal they have already reached and often quit all together.  I have seen it happen dozens of times; they get their black belt, come for a few more classes and never show up again.  They up and quit, and move on to check off yet another task from their list.

There are 4th degrees that have been training 5 years.  13-year-old kids convinced they could handle them selves in bar fights.  All because people take this conception of rank and make the rank important instead of allowing the belt color to simply represent their actual skill level.  This way of thinking cheapens the rank to the point of making it worthless.

A lot of coaches implement the system because they think Americans want it.  I cannot think of a more stupid reason out there.  Just about the only thing it will fix is simplicity of explaining how testing or ranking will work to a new student.  If you explain that there is not need for this sort of system people will normally understand.  And if they don't get it right away they will once they see it in practice.

I understand that the ranking systems can be useful for keeping track of students' progress.  However I believe this can be done with out enforcing the apparently universal system of Japanese style belt ranking.  As you go form school to school the ranking can be so different that it won't even apply.  I have seen orange belts from one school easily beat black belts from another.  So this tells me if you want a rank system for tracking the students' progress that is fine ' just don't use belts.  Please.  Numbered levels would be fine.  Perhaps a nice Chinese style of ranking and call each level a different animal (Crain, tiger, dragon ' yeah it's cheesy) At least it would avoid the apparent universal aspect of a very local system.

A specific school system also leaves open the possibility of using testing as a way to milk your students for more money.  Sometimes this is a necessary evil.  Many schools depend on the supplemental income that testing brings in, others can do just fine with out it.

I see no reason to force a ranking system upon wushu, and allow a means to undermine and cheapen all the hard work we put into it.  If it comes down to belts it will quickly be dragged into a contest of what rank are you ' instead of a contest of skill.  Rank is way too frequently given to those who pay their dues to the school.  Monetarily or otherwise.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Went to gymnastics and wushu yesterday dispite not fully healing from the pulled hamstrings.  I don't feel to bad today.  My quads are a little sore from the frog jumps we did in wushu, but over all I feel pretty good.  Shins are same painful shins.  Aiya.

Well I found out from My Gymnastics Coach Carlos that the owner of Capital wants to get rid of the floor sooner than I thought.  So we have rallied the troops and are gonna try to buy it quickly if we are gonna be able to pull it off at all.  I found out form Emily last night that Sarah's Dad was very interested in it.  So once I was able to track down his email (sarah was grumpy when we was doing homework, sheesh)  I sent him the details.  You know, $2200, needs to be gone by this weekend.

Well he called me back this morning, and he is getting Mr. Ma on our side.  Hopefully they will have a better chance of convincing Lu Xiao Ling to go for it ' we are all offering to jump in and help pay for it.  But it is still two grand.  I found out that the last carpet that they had, Mr. Ma and a buddy of his (Mr. Gee) just bought it out right when they made their last move.  Damn.  They couldn't find any other people to help out with the cost.

I hope I won't have this kinda issues when I have my own school.  I plan on buying a gymnastics floor to start off with.  Or at least a cheerleading roll out floor.  And move up to a suspended foam block one quickly.  Aside form mirrors, I can't think of any other major costs I would have to front then.  Hmmm, I will have to hit up the plans for my school with this stuff.

Kelly took today off and is doing laundry and cleaning up the house to get ready for us to leave for the rest of the week ' for thanksgiving in Richmond.  Hopefully I won't be needed to be around for helping with this floor situation.  But I am all sorts of ready to go see family.  Hopefully my parents will behave and get their fill of us for a while.  I will be great to hang out with Aimee and my sisters for once.  And JACOB!  I am sure he is all big and whatnot.  I gotta go teach him who I am'that cool uncle!]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Well, thanksgiving break is over and I am all sorts of not happy to be back at work.  Stupid work.  And I even forgot my badge so I can't leave here with out having to call someone to let me back in.  Actually this morning I just sat in my car until Kevin showed up and I just walked in with him.  I don't' even think he knew I was sneaking in.  heh.

We went down to Richmond Wednesday night, and had thanksgiving dinner over at grandmas house.  Actually Aimee did all the cooking, it was good stuff.  We did not have any of the Longs, but the Tulli came down and ate with us.   Kelly Nikki and I wound up all staying at grandmas that night, staying up late to play games and watch the special edition of Fellowship of the Ring.

Thursday was going pretty well, until we wanted to watch the second half of Fellowship and my dad couldn't get the DVD player to work ' Kelly asked if he wanted me to help him and he snapped at her.  Then told me through the door of the bathroom (I was sitting on the toilet at the time) that 'I know your wife doesn't respect me, but tell her to be quiet about it some times'  or something along those lines.  I was muchly pissed, and Kelly wanted to leave.  I almost did.

Kelly was crying, and my dad was pouting, so my mom basically made my father call a family meeting.  He did not invite or ask, but told us we had to talk.  Arg.  Anyway, we had a bash session on my dad for a while, and told them all sorts of stuff that has pissed us off ' and they took it very well.  I feel kinda bad for father, because Mom has just as much as he does, but all the issues raised sounded like it was just him.  That is mostly his fault. He kept correcting himself from saying 'we' to 'me' .  Ahh-well.  In the end we were much better off.  Made it better because I was leaving a day early to go install a gymnastics floor at O-Mei.

Speaking of the floor.  I rented a truck and went out to pick it up all by my self.  We had gone jumping through a bunch of hoops to get everything set up and ready, but it got there.  WhenI first showed up I had lots of help from the gymnastics coaches ' so things went really well.  Aside from the fact that I found out I was gonna have to take two trips.  But we finally got everything loaded unloaded and reloaded (this time loading was just me and Kelly) and unloaded again.  When Kelly and I were there for the second loading session it was even snowing on her.  Crazy Girl, some how the snow made her all happy to be out there, she didn't complain or nothing about doing all this work with out the help we should have had.  She rocks more now.

That was Saturday, yesterday (Sunday) we installed the floor.  I had from 9am to 1pm to get things up and running before I had to take off for dinner with Kelly's parents.  But we got stuff very far along actually.  The floor was 2/3 down, and we still needed to build the border around the edges, but that was worked out pretty well.  While we were gone they built up all around the edges and I came back afound 8 to put in the last few screws.  Lemme tell you something, Chinese people don't know how to use a drill.  At least not any of the ones there.  They stripped every screw they put in.  Ruined at least two of the screwdriver bits I brought in ' one was brand new.   But in the end I am happy, we have a nice new floor.  Mr Chang fronted the money'and he was able to talk them down to $1500.  I think most people are happy, but I expect a lot of complaints that the floor is too bouncy or soft.  Which really kinda sucks, because I am so convinced that it is so much better this way.  Hopefully with the amount of work we put into it no one will want to take it up anytime soon.  Not to mention all the stripped screws.

Well for our dinner with the Tulli we first went to go see 'Halleluiah Handel' at the Kennedy center, which was a short little play, no longer than an hour, but it was a fun place.  However Rich and Neil were late, and we were waiting in the wrong place so there was an emergency for a while there.  Esp when we were following a very not happy Kelly up the stairs and we lost her ' so we asked the lady there where our seats were and she sat us down a level ' so Kelly and Janice were up stairs and Her Dad, Brother and Husband were down.  We knew that was badness ' so eventually I went up and found her mom sitting there, and waited till she returned.  After some tears and hugs we went back and sat down and saw the second half of the show.

Dinner at the melting pot was a fantastic success.  We were able to move our reservations up a little and got there right on time.  Neil and I gorged ourselves on the spicy cheese and everyone else had the boring swiss.  So good, so much food.  I dipped everything in the chocolate that I could.  Neil even picked up mints of the floor and ate those, covered on chocolate of course.

Well Kelly just called ' she had her tooth pulled.  Doesn't sound like it was that bad, but she doesn't sound to happy either.  Guess I will not get to test out the floor tonight.  Which is fine, I really need to be with her tonight.  He mom is taking care of her right now, and should still be there when I show up at 5 or so.  Hopefully I can sneak out around 4.  That would be better.

Well, I need to go figure out where I was with my project last week ' stupid work.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Kelly's tooth removal was rather eventful.  I am prolly happy that her mom was able to take care of her during the day.  She fainted during the actual procedure, so they all hard to stop and see if she was ok.  The drugs they gave her make her rather ill so she wound up throwing up a few times last night.  Most of the time she sat around looking not so happy.

This not making me want to get my wisdom teeth removed next Friday.  That was only one tooth, and it was up close and easy to get too, I have 4 teeth to worry about, and they are impacted on the bottom and everything.  Not so excited about that.

Double sucks, because Kelly is out of town tonight. Arg, stupid her work.

I finally got Xiang Bo's correct email address and I emailed him about the webpage, wound up getting his AmEx card number and ordering it for him.  So it looks like I will have the control over that.  Yet another one on my list.  O-Mei should not be hard at all, they don't' have the drive that Chris Pei had to make his website the best that there is'.plus I will have freedom to play with it how ever I want.

One good thing about today is I get to go play on the nice new floor at wushu ' during sword class, then I will run off to capital for a little flippin'.  Emily has been saying she wants to go, and last week Stephan sounded interested.  I also get to tote the $1500 from Mr. Chang to capital for the floor.  Hmm, maybe I should run off to Mexico with it'.

Dean from KS is coming to town Friday, I am rather excited about it.   I have never seen this boy in the flesh, but from out AIM and email conversations I think we wont' have any trouble getting along.  Sounds much more exciting than the other Christopher Sexton.  That guy kinda spooks me.

In conclusion:  Teeth are scary.  Train harder (as always) and don't eat French fries.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Arg, what a wasted day.  I know I have actually done work but it sure don't' feel like it.  Now it is just about 4, and that means only an hour of the day left.  I was hear rather late last night, but I hope to get out of here earlier today.  I want to get my hair cut and Kelly's phone fixed before wushu.  So I can't be leaving at 6:15 again tonight.

I was reading some of Stadion's news letters today and I am gonna have to swear off French fries and soda.  I am seriously gonna try to not eat/drink them any more.  I will reserve soda for special situations and try to avoid French fries all together.  Damn, I like them both so much, but they are so bad for me.  Must have will power, must refuse to eat crap.  I bet my skin clears up in a month if I am successful.  I neglect nutrition too much.

All this research makes me want to go get a degree in Applied Kinesiology or Sports Medicine.  Certs are pretty much worth less and I am not sure that it would be worth the money.  Maybe I will just go for one any way because it is only a weekend of work.

Wushu and gymnastics were good last night.  I was proud I was able to give out my card twice today.  Once to Vyvy at wushu (inviting her to our b-day gathering) and the other to Kyle at gymnastics (inviting him to our b-day gathering).  Both of them have prior arrangements but want to come later.  So I am down with that.

Kelly seems to be doing better with her tooth situation, she had to take three Tylenols earlier today, but she doesn't have to use the prescription stuff.  Plus it makes her sick.

Lesson from today:  Soda makes bones weaker, I need strong bones.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Crazy last two days.  It snowed a good 6' here.  I took Kelly to work in the jeep and then I jumped on the metro yesterday.  And today for that matter.  I would rather not take her car on the road when it is all covered in salt.

The DVD player died two days ago, so we went out an dbougnt a new one yesterday.  It was kinda nice, because Kim did not show up to work, so I pretty much spend all day researching DVD players, and I was able to pick out one that did exactly what we want.  I got the Panasonic RV32 ' a lot of people on VCDhelp.com seemed to like it.  Plus it was $99 after a rebate.I almost got an Apex one, they are rather hacker friendly, but they pretty much require you to hack it (just to play VCD's, ugh).  I tested a lot fo stuff out on it and every thing I tried worked just fine.  So I am a happy boy.  Plus we needed a DVD player because Dean comes in tonight (and Gerald and everyone one else) for my b-day weekend.  Which Glenn has dubbed national Super Fly Day.  I am down with that yo.

My hammies are rather tender from class on Wednesday; I think it was the up-downs at the end of class that really toasted them.  I could feel them doing that sorta-cramp thing they do when they are hurting. Now I have done something to my ankle, right across the top where the foot meets the leg ' where peter hurt himself.  Oh, speaking of peter, I will go write him an email to invite him to my b-day thing.  BRB'.well I sent it.

I think I sound pretty desperate to him now, but I have to keep trying, maybe he really is busy and doesn't actually hate me.  *whimper*

Well, I am crazy excited aobut this weekend, it is 1:00 now, and I will be taking off in a couple of hours to go find dean, and we can head back home ' go to wushu ' meet with wushu peeps ' talk about wushu ' do some more wushu ' dream about wushu ' wake up to wushus ' and go do wushu ' watch some wushu on TV'you know the normal. Yay!]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Well this weekend was a blast.  I left work around 2:30 or 3 on Friday to go meet dean at the airport.  He is much taller than I expected him to be.  Really didn't look like how I thought.  Not that it is a bad thing, or that I even care, I just figured I would have a better mental image of the guy from the videos/pictures I had seen.  His wushu was surprisingly good.  Some stuff was a little awkward but his b-twists and front snap kicks were crazy clean.  Plus he had this old school flavor.  It was cool having him come hang out.  I do feel like I kinda ignored him a little too much, like during my b-day party I don't' think I talked to him that much, I was playing games and laughing it up with some of the old USWA peeps.

Training was good.  Friday, I took both the intermediate and advanced class.  I also saw the Ba Gua class.  I really want to take that.  Only problem is it happens on Friday at 5.  I am gonna try to go, however.  Ba Gua is so intriguing to me, plus I need to start learning some of the 'slower' wushu styles.  And I don't think I am ready for taiji slow just yet. Chen is hella interesting though.  Anyway, by the time we finished Saturday class my shins were killing me.   I am taking tonight off to lift and heal.

They were building the rest of the floor on Saturday after class, I wish I could have helped more, but people were in town and I had to go make showings at different places.  Gerald, Sean, Dean and I did help haul in lumbar.  So we are not THAT bad.   You should have seen Emily when she noticed sean was at O-Mei.  Heh.

Kelly Gerald and I went over to Todd's place for his and Marilee's little Christmas Open House thingy, it was pretty cool.  So much food, she really like entertaining I think.  Found out Brian Key Eloped.  Nice to see Todd, too bad Beej wasn't there.

Sunday was nice.  We all took dean to the airport and had lunch with him.  We were sitting at the little mini-bar thing at the TGI Fridays in national, and had an extra guy at out table.  We made friends with him and Sean dealt him into the card game 'thief' we have been playing, that was cool.  Fun game too.

After Chinese school on Sunday I came home and Kelly was asleep and Sean was still playing video games.  I really like having him over, but it was time for some alone time with my wife.  So we told him we were gonna go out to dinner.  I am pretty sure he knew we had not intention of leaving, but wanted to ask him to leave nicely.  He even apologized for over-staying.  We like Sean a lot, even when he overstays.  Crazy guy.

Chinese class was fun too; there were 4 of us.  The other three were teenagers, Pan Hong Gon, Shu Ling jing, Fei Wen Hao and me.  They all got yelled at for not practicing, but she said I was exempt from the yelling because I am old and try hard.  But they are young and would learn fast if they would try just a little bit more.  Heh.  I guess the difference is I think it would be really cool if I could speak Chinese and they are being forced to go class.  Go figure.

Realization: My Chinese is not nearly good enough to go to China with, I have no oral comprehension.  Dean is tall. Train harder, longer and more often ' gotta get ready for China.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Big ice storm today.  Not nearly as messy as last weeks snow storm ' almost everyone has come into work today, unlike last week when it was just me and Kevin with a few managers.  That was much more fun than today is looking.  Plus I have my performance review with Petek later.  I think they will like me just fine, but I always worry I am gonna get yelled at.  The last one went great so I expect this one will too.  But I will worry a little just in case.

Went to wushu and gymnastics last night.  Sword class was fun, Coach fixed a pretty major problem with the end of my section one ' after the scales, the little swing around thing.  I needa practice it so I can stick it every time, but I can tell it is much better now.  Gymnastics was uneventful, I still am only doing roundoff-backhandsprings, but next week I am gonna get Carlos to spot me for the final backtuck on the end.  Then maybe I can more onto two handsprings in a row.  Once I get that I will be much happier.  I need a few big gains there still.

Kelly may be stuck in Richmond tonight.  I am not very happy about it, not mad at her or anything silly like that, but rather annoyed at CapitalOne, they are insisting that she stay and go to this Christmas party, so by the time she can get back on the road it will be cold and all the rain will be freezing again.  Arg. I hope she gets home safe.

Freezing rain sucks something hairy.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Crazy day.  I was actually working very hard and getting quite a bit accomplished until Kim decided to call a meeting with me and Kevin.  We spent the last 30 minutes talking about Christmas shopping and our home computers failing.  He says I need to get a new motherboard battery for mine and home and it will work.  I doubt it, but I will give it a try.  I kinda need that computer to work for some audio stuff I wanna do.

Well Jason came up with Kelly last night, and he is staying at our place right now.  I think I am skipping wushu tonight so I can hang out with him before his flight to Venezuela in the morning.  He is flying out at 7:23 AM.  I have my wisdom teeth appointment at 9:00 AM.  I can't eat or drink for 6 hours before that, so it kinda sucks that I need to get up so early that day, instead of sleeping in right up till I needa go be sedated.  At least I get the day off, sucks to miss the division Christmas party.  Man, so I am only getting a half day off, because tomorrow was gonna be a nice short one.

I met up with tom at the rosslyn metro station.  I was gonna go help him get his movie into a format that I can use for the DVD.  When I got off the train he said they had CD burners on those computers but no Burner software.  Arg.  Plus no network connection there ' so uploading it to my server was not an option. At least he gave me a ride home, and were able to get some mei guo zhong guo fan.  Mmmmm, panda express.

Wushu was pretty good.  Crazy small class, I guess it had to do with the ice storm. I stayed after and talked with Stephan about going to china.  Looks like he is planning on going in march.  He would just skip 2 weeks of school.  I don't' know if I think that is good devotion or carelessness.  Too bad they don't want to go in Feb.  I bought my tickets yester day!  Only thing left for me to do is get my visa.  The travel agent says to wait till January.  So I will.  She also called today because the special fair she was giving me ends on Feb. 6th. So my Feb. 8th is gonna be and extra $70.  That sucks, but it is still better than the other prices I had found.

Excited about china.  I wish Kelly could go with me.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Well the teeth are out.  I never swelled up too bad, but I have switched form the almighty Vikadin to Tylenol.   There is a pretty consistent pain in my upper right jaw, but I am much better than I was a few days ago.  The surgery went pretty well, only took like twenty minutes.  Of course I don't remember anything after they put the Nitrous Oxide nose cup on me.  I do remember when they were getting me up, I would only talk in Chinese for some reason.  I think it really annoyed Kelly, poor girl.  Apparently I also would bark at people as they walked by the door to the operating room I was in.   I remember feeling pretty good then.  I even did cartwheels when I got home.  Those drugs they gave me were pretty fun.

Unfortunately they wore off pretty quick.  I didn't' sleep much, but I did lots of lying down with ice on my face,  If I sat up I would feel nauseous, maybe it was the drugs, or the blood draining down the throat.  It was pretty unhappy.

Nikki was came up that Friday night, took her forever, she didn't leave Adam's house after she called, so we got really worried an hour and a half later.  Kelly left me and Sean at home to go look for her.  Then when she finally did leave to come over she got off on Rt 50 off I66 instead of I395. That will screw you up. So she went out past the airport until she called to get directions.  Crazy girl.

The next day Nikki and Kelly went to a movie and Sean and I went up to the game store in Rockville.   Dream wizards is a pretty cool place, they have quite a bit more non-RPG stuff than most game stores.  I got Aimee a Go set for Christmas and picked up a bunch of CheapAss Games for other random presents.   After going the wrong way on the beltway and I270 we stopped at Tyson's I to get Kelly her Christmas present at the jewelry store.  Sean and I had a number of interesting discussions about why he didn't like jewelry stores.  I am happy with the gift I got her.  I almost gave it to her early last night because I am excited about it.

Chinese school was interesting, in Chinese class we had a substitute teacher.  It was almost not worth going to class for that.  WE wasted a lot of time talking about Christmas in china.  I did get a few good vocabulary things for stuff to say to my kids in wushu.  Speaking of my kids on wushu -- they are so awesome, they gave me Christmas presents.  I didn't expect that.  So did the principal, she gave me a check for $100.  Makes me really want to go a good job for them.

Ugh, I feel nauseous, and I really wanna lie down.  And it is only 10:30 in the morning.  Maybe I will go home early.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Still suffering from side effects from the surgery.  I called the doctor's office yesterday and told htem aobu the pain in the upper right side of my mouth.  They made me come it so that Dr. LaBriola could take a look.  Turns out it is muscle cramping from my jaw.  So painful.  So he gave me some new meds.  'Lodine XL'  Man, I hate taking more drugs ' but this stuff worked great for about 8 hours, then the pain was back and in force.  It is supposed to last a good 12 hours, but it starts to wear off after about 6, hurts like hell after about 10.  I took my first dose yesterday as soon as I got it at about 4:30 or so.  I was golden for a while.  Even went to sword class.  Ate dinner at the Bell no problem.  As I was going to bed I was hurting again ' just not very bad.  I was able to go to sleep.  Then, at 3 AM I woke up with serious pain.  Felt like someone had hit me in the face with an Ax.  From the bottom of my jaw to my ear and temple it was a overwhelming pain.  I lasted about 30 min trying the heating pad and moaning a lot before I took some more Lidine XL, in about an hour it kicked in and I was sleeping like a baby.  Well.  Now it is 11 AM, 8 hours after I took it. And the pain is back.  I was hoping that it was a drug that would build up in your system, and it would be more potent after a few doses, but it doesn't seem that way.  The suckiest thing is I called the dentist at 10:30 or so and it rang a dozen times and I went directly to hold.  So I hung up.  Called back at 11 and got the after hours service ' they are out to lunch until 1:30.  I should be in some mighty good pain by then.  Yay!

Some good news is I got the DVD done.  Burned 3 copies, and designed and printed out a few covers for the case.  Looks pretty good.  I went to Best buy and Staples looking for DVD cases, but no luck.  So I ordered a pack from Shop4Tech.com ' until they get here I am just gonna take some of my DVD's out of their case and use those.

We are going to dinner with Greg, Sean, Keye, Paulo and Mel so I would like to give them their copies tonight if I can.  I need to print out a few more covers before I leave on the nice color laser printer ' so far I only have 2.

I am gonna try to do some coding, it is very hard to do when you hurt.  Especially an all-consuming pain like this one.  I knew I should have jumped out the window on Friday like I wanted to.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Well, I called the Oral Surgeon and he prescribed me a fun new muscle relaxer, Norflex.  Not as effective as the Lodine stuff, but I hope it will last longer.  I woke up in pain last night after the Lodine wore off, and the Norflex should have still been going strong ' but there was a good amount of pain.  However it was a little different than the pain I was having the night before/yesterday.  Last night the pain was down in the joint of the jaw as opposed to the muscle that run up along my face to the temple.  The new pain also kinda wraps around and under my jaw bone ' and made it difficult to swallow, almost like a sore throat.  I think it is all just the muscles that surround that joint and thus it is all the same problem.

The most fun was actually getting the muscle relaxers.  I called them yesterday and Dr. LaBriola just said that he would prescribe them to me, so the lady called them into CVS.  I got called into a meeting soon after that so I was not able to leave until about 4PM.  When I finally got to CVS they said I didn't have anything called in.  So I called the Doctors Office ' but Wednesday is their day off so I got an answering service, they paged Dr. Cantor for me.  He didn't know what to do or what Dr. Labriola was trying to do so he wanted me to come in the next morning.  And told me to take the Lodine every 8 hours for the pain.  So I went and took a Lodine and headed home.  Once I was home I got a call from the lady that was supposed to call in my prescription and said that she made a mistake and she called in the correct one.  So I call CVS and they say it will be 45 min or so.  I run off to pick that up once it is ready.  But now I have taken my Lodine at the wrong time and it won't last through the night.  So like clockwork I wake up at 2 AM with lots of fun pain.  Ugh.

I think wushu and other training is on hold for now until I get this jaw thing solved.  It is really getting old.

Last night we met up with Keye, Greg, Paulo, Melanie, Sean, Glenn and sometimes Tom (he had to leave early).  We went to Chevy's, which was good, but I ate a lot of chips and that worked my jaw quite a bit.  I gave out a few copies of the Peking Duck DVD as Christmas presents and I think every one was honestly excited to get them.  However that first batch didn't have Tom's movie on it, because he just gave me the mpeg2 file at dinner.  So I will burn a few more and it will have a surprise on it.

Pain Check: its 11am, the pain is present but not overwhelming yet.  Cant take lodine till 2 (if I play by the rules), but I may take it at 12, so I can take it again at 12 tonight to help me sleep.  I figure shaving off 2 hours here of there for it won't do that much harm.  I hope.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Well I just noticed that I had mad it a full 12 hours since I took my lodine last.  The pain is coming back but not nearly as large or powerful as it was before.  I am not on a schedule of taking my drugs that seems to be working.  I am getting better.  Not good yet, but much better than I was.

Kelly and I had dinner with Jeannie and Danny last night.  She is getting her wisdom teeth pulled this morning.  Poor girl.  And I think they are driving up to NJ on Sunday.  I would not have wanted to travel 2 days after I had mine pulled.  Esp. because I had to go back in to see the surgeon for these muscle pains.

Kelly has the day off.  In fact she has the rest of the year off.  So she will come have lunch with me.  She will run some errands while I finish up the day and they we will go see a movie.  (The Two Towers! Yay!)  She even dropped me off at the metro this morning so she can take me home at the end of the day.

Definitely not going to wushu tonight, maybe I will try for Saturday if I feel up for it.  With my current drug schedule that may work out pretty well, 2 hours after I take the lodine I should be able to go to class with no pain.  Might be a good idea to wait till next week but I am gonna try to go.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[It was a good weekend.  So much good time with Kelly.  We actually stayed up last night till 2 AM talking.  I was just so happy to be hanging out with her.  I didn't have Chinese school yesterday so I was with her the entire day.  Saturday too for that matter, except for a little break for some wushu.  We really were just happy to be together.  Sunday we came home from church after doing a little shopping and wound up reading for a few hours in bed.  It was nice.  No artificial lights, only the sun coming through the window and reflecting off the wall.  Kelly eventually fell asleep, but it was nice.  After we got going again we wrapped and sorted all the Christmas presents, which slowly transformed into cleaning the house. We scrubbed the kitchen down real good, and were able to pick up the living room after all the crazy present wrapping.

Saturday was fun, not as much fun as Sunday, but still fun.  We went and saw The Two Towers.  Kelly was a little disappointed a few of the changes, but other than a few complaints about how Tree Beard should have been nicer she loved it.  Less than 2 minutes after returning home she was reading the novel again. Before the show I took Kelly to Five guys, that was fun ' she had been wanting a good burger for a while.

Actually she has fallen in love with a few restaurants in Alexandria.  On Friday I took her to La Piazza, and she loved it.  Honestly raved about it.  Liked five guys just fine.  Peanuts and all.  Mmmmm greasy burger.

Well we are picking up Jason at the airport tonight, and then driving down the Richmond for Christmas Eve with my 'rents.  We will head back up here tomorrow night for Christmas Eve.  Kelly's parents will stop in for Christmas breakfast just before they ship her father off to TX.  I am actually looking forward to that meal.  Kelly is going all out.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Well Christmas was a success.  We went to Richmond for dinner at grandma's and came up that night for a late night present exchange with me and the wife.  The next morning Kelly's parents came by for brunch.

I guess it was a little more exciting than that.

Kelly and I picked up Jason at the airport as he was returning form Costa Rica.  Didn't see any monkeys.  But he was happy to find out that his woman was happy to see him.  This is good.  He told her that if she didn't go live in India that he would marry her.  I hope she comes back for him.  Then she can marry him and move off to china (instead of India) for a missionary life style ' and Kelly and I can go with them.  Heh.  We went down to Richmond that night after getting Jason at Dulles around 10 pm.  Didn't get to my 'rents house till around 1 am.  Not too bad since Jason lives on south side.

It was raining in Richmond when we were leaving, but there was a 20 band of freezing rain around Fredericksburg and snow up in DC.  Drive didn't take that long but it was rather stressful. Kelly's parents were able to come in the next morning with out incident ' however there were a number of cars forcibly parked against the jersey walls. Rich flew out to Texas that afternoon and the rest of us we and saw Catch Me if You Can.  Good movie.

My parents did good for Kelly for Christmas ' got her a bread maker.  Kitchen appliances are always a good thing for her.  However she is starting to feel like her kitchen is too small for all her stuff.  We still have some empty cabinet spaces but it is filling up for sure.  I got a bunch of soft presents.  So much clothing, Kelly's parents went all out and got me a whopping $250 gift certificate for Jos. A. Banks.  Dress clothes.  Hrmrmm.  That could have been an iPod!  But I guess I would rather not pay for the dress clothes that I will have to buy anyway.  Wrinkle free slacks are good for me.

My Jaw is finally getting better.  I defiantly still have muscle problems. If I push on the inside of my cheek where the muscle attaches to the lower jaw I can feel a good amount of tension on the right side.  However I am trying to wait more than 12 hours between taking my drugs. I still have plenty of Narflex (muscle relaxers) but I am down to my last 2 Lodine.  That's the good stuff, and I don't' wanna take it unless I have to ' so I am kinda saving it.  Even though the directions say take every 12 hours until finished.  So one every 24 hours shouldn't be that much different, right?

Jeannie got her wisdom teeth removed and only took 2 ibuprofen.  That dork.  This has been hell for me ' but at least I can go back to wushu... Oh, Jeannie gave me a Play Station game ' the same one she gave me last year.  I had it then too.  I exchanged it at best buy for Vice City. So I am happy.  I just don't' have the heart to tell her.

Kelly is at home today.  I wanna go hang out with her.  These last few days have been nothing but time together, and I am getting spoiled.

Conclusion:  Gotta take Kelly to china with me.  Weather she likes it or not ' I will have more fun if she comes along.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Did I ever say that my sister discovered that she is pregnant? Well they thought it was twins at first.  'They' being Mat and Laura ' not a trained medical person that had any right to make such a claim.  They also based that thought on sheer speculation and one lady who thought that God was prophesying through her when she touched Laura.  But Laura went into the Doctor and the years of med school says that Laura is only having one baby.  This is good.  I think they will be better off with only one more.  I think 2 kids is ideal for them.  For us too, for that matter.  Kelly and I have talked about it a number of times and I think we are pretty settled on 2 kids.  Now, if we can only arrange it so we have a boy first and a girl second.  I know if we adopt that will make three ' details.  Pfftt.

We talked to Tina and Qiu Dong last night for quite a while.  Qiu Dong wanted me to put off my trip to china for a month because he was having a friend (James) who is going.  I am worried about them, need to pray for them more, not for an specific reason, but I do want to see them succeed.  It seems that living with her parents is really hard on him.  Tina seems to question his desire to spend time with her.  Poor girl.  It has to be really hard to be in the situation that they are in.  I am pretty sure they have not told her parents that they are legally bound, but I don't even know if her 'rents know they are a couple.  Plus QDX wants to prove to them that he can take care of Tina, and getting a job now is hard ' even for those college educated English speaking people; much less a Wushu Athlete with sketchy English.  However, he is getting better ' we talked for at least an hour yesterday and didn't have much trouble talking at all.

Don't think we are going to do much for new years this time around.  Kelly has a co-worker that is having a party we may go to ' but she said I could round up the wushu peeps.  I may give people a call this afternoon to see if they are down with that.  We'll see.  Maybe we can do something on new years day instead'

Training has been going pretty well, my hamies have been a little delicate recently ' I pulled my left leg during basics on Saturday.  Right at the beginning ' during Punch-Kick drills.  I didn't do any more left leg stuff that entire class.  Which really sucked because I was all psyched up for tornado splits.  The serious conditioning for my hamstrings starts today.  Gonna hit them and my lower legs harder and more consistently ' gotta get ready for China.

Wisdom Hole Update:  Got big gaping hole in 3 of the 4 places.  The bottom right one is CRAZY cold sensitive.  The other ones are just annoying when food gets stuck down in there.  I hope this is normal and will go away.  Muscle pain is pretty much gone, which is good because the meds are completely gone.

New years resolution?  Eat better (trite, ain't it). Train more. Pray more.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Well I talked to Paulo last night and got a few emails form Greg ' we are doing new years over at Greg and Sean's place.  I feel rather bad that I just dissed Kelly's friend Jen with out even a second thought.  BUT we get to hang out with a bunch of cool people that we all feel comfortable with and would like to see more often.  Looks like the list of attendees is: Greg, Sean, Paulo, Melanie, Suzie, Kelly and Me.  Maybe Keye. Not a very big gathering but great for playing some games and all that.

Didn't go to wushu last night even though I can't go tonight or tomorrow.  I think it was a good choice.  I got to hang out with Kelly and it was really nice.  She didn't let us get sucked into to sitting around staring at the TV or nothing.  We had a test run of Hoopla and then played a game of Go.  (I was supposed to play Cameron last night, but had to go to bed).  Kelly also was able to sneak in a hour long nap while I did some work on the computer.

I had a terrible time getting to sleep last night.  Just tossing and turning.  I really should have turned on the light and read some of FOTR, but I thought I was tired enough to drift off into sleepy land.

New favorite word: disport: to amuse one self in a light frolicsome manner.  I used it a few times yesterday for some reason and decided that I like it. Kelly wanted to know how I knew words she didn't.  I think that is 1 word she didn't know to a large pile that I don't know.  Don't get me started on her math skills.  At least I have my powers of two.  No. Wait.  I can't do those anymore past 1024.  How sad.

Time to work.  Kim is making me leave 2 hour early and charge it to vacation.  Arg.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Whelp, just got back from lunch with josh.  We went to Subuway.  Ugh.  I really wanted to spend my going out to lunch money on somewhere better but that was OK.  I found out that Josh proposed to his woman on Christmas.  Didn't get her the typical diamond but went for a sapphire.  I don't think he is very excited about this whole thing, like he is settling or something ' but I could be wrong.  Perhaps he really does love her.

New years was fun.  We all hung out at Greg's place and played lots of games.  Sarah and Cheryl showed up all dressed up in goin' out clothes.  They made the rest of us all feel old.  Sean mentioned something about how that had never happened before, but they made him feel real good and old.  The Virginia Tech-Air Force bowl game was disappointing, but we did come out with the win.  Had to come from behind and they were always within reach of taking the win.  It should have been a game dominated by VT.  Not like I am a big football fan or anything.

We went back to our place at like 12:30 or so.  Told Sean that he was welcome to come over and play video games.  Went home and played Vice City till 3:30 or so.  Go up the next morning and Sean was playing Jak and Dexter.  We wound up making breakfast and cleaning and laundry all day.  Sean hung around playing video games while Kelly and I busied ourselves with that stuff.  Finally got cleaned up from Christmas.

Later that night after we sent Sean on his way we ran to Target and tried to get a Rubbermaid wrapping paper tub, but they were sold out.  We got Kelly a canvas sock drawer thingy and I picked up the 'Evening with Kevin Smith' DVD.  Great stuff.

Wushu Tonight.  Gymnastics next week after a good three weeks with out.  My hams are better, but my left it tender again. I hope I didn't hurt it yesterday when I was trying to condition it.  Prolly did.  Need to get better soon.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Fox went and canned Firefly.  I really liked that show.  I know I didn't catch it every week (being during wushu and all) but I had been taking Friday nights off to rest and recover and I was making sure to catch it when I was at home.  Cowboys in space.  It was great. Alas.

I took the metro in today.  Partly because it snowed last night and partly because I wanted to. Unfortunately I didn't get into the office until 9:30 or so.   There were some nasty delays on the metro.  We kept making these rebarbative stops mid tunnel on the orange line.  And when I got down to the blue line platform at Rosslyn I found it full of people staring at the 'Delays on the Blue line' sign.  Didn't bother me too much, I was not pressed to get to work this morning, and it allowed me some time to stretch and do my Chinese flash cards.  Of course I didn't do any Chinese clash cards.

I find the social interactions on the subway very intriguing.  I mean you are nto allowed to make eye contact.  Well you can, but is seems like is it just as forward as going up and touching someone when you have plenty of room to avoid the contact.  In order to avoid eye contact (and not just stare off into space, or at your feet) you must watch for the slow blink.  Everyone tends to have a nice prolonged blink before they change their eye position.  If you are looking at them and they close their eyes in order to reposition their eyes you best glance away.

I started off this weekend with a subaltern game of go verses Cameron.  Lost to him.  Dangit. He did have a 7 stone handicap, but still, I should have done better.  I also played against Kelly and Sean.  No, no multiplayer go, they were at different times.  Both on the 13 board. I also had fun playing Neal-o on KGS after he watched the game between Cameron and me. He said I made him my Go Bitch.  I am thinking I would rather have some other sorts of Bitches, but a Go Bitch is not the worst kind you can have by any means.  Nice to get back into the game for a bit.  I need to play on KGS like once a week so I can keep some forward progress with my Go skills.

I learned the first and the fourth sections of compulsory broadsword.  Not nearly as difficult as sword ' for me.   Of course that may has something to do with a year and a half of Broadsword at USWA.  I think I am going to learn the compulsory and switch back to straight sword.  I need to decide which weapon I am going to use for team trials soon.  Coach Lu recommends I go to china and get their input.

I believe in the long run I will be better at sword than broadsword.  So the question becomes do I concentrate on that for the long term now, or to I take something (i.e. staff or b-sword) and hope that they will be better for the short term.  I am leaning toward straight sword right now.  At least I will know 4 entire compulsory forms by the end of this week.

China in 33 days.  *shakes with excitement*]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Crisis averted.  We have been working on this database stuff at work for a while now.  They still insist on doing it in misrosoft products.  And when the upgraded my PC to SP3 for windows 2000 it broke the ODBC connection to the SQL Server.  We spent the last 2 days trying to get it up and running.  It got frantic and the pressure was on to get it working.  I was reduced to swinging my arms around in the dark and I go lucky and hit it.  Some weird-ass registry change.

Thank God that has be put down.  Remember, never use shoddy M$ products if you can help it.

Learned section 3 of Compulsory Broadsword last night.  Need to practice it so I don't forget.  Finally went for round off-back hand spring-back tuck.  Thank god Carlos was spotting me. Or I would have crashed the first one so bad.  I Rush it way too much, and think about the tuck when I should be dealing with the handspring.  I tried it less than half a dozen times.  Drilled round off back hand springs for a while.  Actually, on one of those round off back hand springs my knees buckled and it tweaked my back.  So right in the middle of my back I have a wonderful pain.  Like the vertebra were wedged together and bruised.  Makes sitting more dreadful than normal.

Goal: get this trick before china.

I need to work on doing my back handsprings like normal.  Travel back and punch afterwards.  I get crazy height out of the handspring if I don't flip.  So I need to train my body for that.

I applied for my Visa for China yesterday.  Sometimes it is nice living in D.C. I can run up to the Chinese Embassy and do that.  I didn't have an extra passport picture, so I made on the computer and printed it out.  They didn't notice the photoshoping I had done to it ' Removing the background and facial blemishes.  They said to come back Friday afternoon.  I need to remember the $30 in cash for the fee.

I broke my right front fender flare.  I was at a car wash to try and get the salt off the jeep and found out I didn't have any $1, $5 or $10 bills so I had to back up and I was paying attn to where I was going backwards and turned to sharp and hit the sign for the prices.  Stupid mistake.  At least it will be under $50 to get fixed.  I prolly would not fix it if I hadn't of broken the clear orange indicator cover.

Turns out O-Mei is hosting the team trials.  So I won't have to travel or anything to go to them.  I will however be doing artwork and webpage stuff for it.  I think they are trying to have it take place at the NOVA Campus off of Little River Turnpike.  One stop down from me on the beltway.  Convenient.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<b>Physical status:</b> Caves are sore, hams are feeling great, back little tender. Lets not talk about my shins.

I went up to Best Buy and grabbed a birthday present for Kelly's best friend, Jeannie.   We wanted to get her something nice and fun, but were at a loss.  So I picked up a Sony Clie with a gift receipt.  If she doesn't want a Palm she can take it back and get a felicitous amount of DVDs.  It was only a buck thirty, but a pretty nice little gizmo none the less.  I wanted to run down to Sports Authority and get a medicine ball but I had already spent $65 to get the fender flare and $40 for another Tomas Kurz book today.  So I decided I need to just wait.

Carlos gave me some good training advice when I asked him what he has his boys do for lifting and what not.  He said that they mostly use weights for holding positions like they would on rings, but he recommended that I do some plyometric exercises for upper body.  Pushups that hop up and down off of blocks (he suggested phone books), and the like.  According to him I should be fine with the current program I have for my legs and abs ' however he did suggest more explosive exercises for the trunk.

We are supposed to have dinner with Jeannie tonight, but I want to go to wushu.  Kelly is going for sure, but I think I am either going to go late or just skip all together.  Turns out I talked to my x-co-worker Neil and a bunch of my buddies from IMAKE are going up to Baltimore Saturday night.  Which is when we were going to have dinner with Jeannie and her 'rents.  Kelly wants to go because we often go to dinner with them and they pay for our meals ' and this one is at home, so they don't have to pay.  I am sure the McHughs don't think that at all, but it would be nice to have some evidence in our favor. But it would also be nice-nice to go hang out with the old gang.  Don't think both is a good option.  We'll see, I guess.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[It's official I got my Chinese visa.  I am all set to go. However I got an email from Cirque.  Here is what is said:

<blockquote>
Montreal, January 8, 2003
Bonjour,
We are pleased to inform you that you have been selected to take part in the next martial arts & stunt audition in Las Vegas.

<blockquote>
        <b>When:  <u> Tuesday, February 11th, 2003</u>
        Where:  Cirque du Soleil Theater Myst're
Treasure Island at the Mirage </b>
                        3300, Las Vegas Blvd. south
                        Las Vegas, Nevada
</blockquote>

Registration is at <u> 8:30 AM.</u>  The audition begins at 9:00 AM and ends around 7:00 PM.  Candidates will be eliminated throughout the course of the day.

<u>You are not required to prepare anything in advance</u>. This audition will allow us to evaluate your physical and technical abilities as well as your artistic potential, while paying special attention to your personality.

Please wear your favorite training outfit to the audition. Martial arts specialist are asked to  bring their own weapons.
You are asked whether to confirm your attendance at the audition or the reason of your absence. To do so, you can contact me at the International Headquarters in Montreal at (514) 723-xxxx, ext. xxx, by fax at (514) 723-xxxx, or by e-mail at &#91;deleted to be nice&#93;

<b>By omitting to contact us, we will consider that you are no longer interested and we will consequently take your name off of our lists. </b>
See you soon!

C'line Lemay
Auditions Coordinator
P.S.  We suggest you to bring a lunch, should you stay with us the whole day.
</blockquote>

This would be wonderful except my trip for china is supposed to depart on February 8th. So I don't know what I am going to do.  Once I got this email it was the end of productive work for that day.  I immediately replied with my sob story hoping to obviate any problems and get a rescheduled audition.  Originally they offered 3 times that we could come and show off our skills, but I guess it is easier if they can fit us all in early at a place they own.  It would be crazy cool to go and actually audition in Vegas at the Mystere theater, but I don't want to start my trip to china with a let down should I get cut.  That would make for a sucky time.

Paulo did point out that I might get the part (or second audition) and I would be all sorts of happy and go to china and buy my friends nice mahjong sets in a state of utter bliss.

Excited and nervous about the entire thing.  China and Cirque, both.

Well on the up side Kelly came and had lunch with me.  It was nice because everyone else here at work seemed to be going to lunch as a big group, so they would be gone for at least an hour and a half.  Kelly and I were able to take out sweet time and wander around Georgetown to find a little restaurant for lunch.  We went o Mon Cherie (sp?), and while it sounds French, it is just a regular deli.  They put Italian Dressing on my Gyro.  Tasted fine, but it was not really a Gyro.  After that we stopped by Starbucks and grabbed a Chai ' then headed back to the Visa Office to pick up my passport.  Yay!

I think we are going to go out to dinner with all the old wushu gang tonight.  Hopefully Lost Dog.  Then saterday after Wushu we are going to jeannie's for dinner.  Looks like we are gonna miss the trip to Baltimore with them IMAKEians, that sucks, but they were going out and gonna be out all night type thing, not really my thing.  Sunday after Chinese school Josh and Dmitry are going to come over for a few games of Go.  I'm sure I can get Sean to show for that as well.  Should be fun.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<b>Quick Update!</b>
 Cirque got back to me:
<blockquote>
Dear Christopher,

We could invite you in New York for a martiaL art audition in April (around the 12th).  Would it be more convenient for you?  I think that it would be awfull to cancell your terip to China.

Please advise if April would be OK for you.

Best regards
</blockquote>
So much better.  Only possible conflict would be Elizabeth's Wedding that I am supposed to film on April 5th.  but that is not exactly "around" the 12th.  Still if I miss that it would be less then ideal, but much closer to the perfect audition than canceling China]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Well it was a good weekend.  Started out on Friday by us going to Lost Dog with Sean, Glenn and eventually Adrian.  Glenn had his usual rants about wushu, which were as always entertaining.  He and Adrian had some insightful comments on Cameron's level of annoying-ness.

Friday wushu class was good, hadn't done a Chang Quan class in a while.  My lower legs were hurting after that one.  I iced when I got home.

As usual, Sean came back and we played some games.  About 1/2 a game of Go, and he played a bunch of Jak and Daxter.  Apparently he dreamt about that game.  Well, not so much about that game, but he had a dream where the camera operated in the same way as it does in the game.  It is overwhelmingly funny that Sean, of all people, would be having video game induced dreams.

Reminds me of Mario brothers on the NES, I would close my eyes and see koopas.

My legs hurt like crazy in Saturday's class, I made it through basics, and I sorta slacked off when we were doing the chang quan sets.  Once we got to weapons I was fine because I am still just learning b-sword.  I had to land the jumping drills with two legs.  I always feel like I should push harder when I tell the coach I am gonna slack off.  Prolly smarter to take is easy.

Yesterday was the first Chinese school in a long time.  Unfortunately during that long time I completely forgot my Chinese.  I struggled through that.

My Kids were pretty good in class, and they are getting better.  The oldest, Lawrence, asked me if he had to go to the other classes in order to come to Wushu. He said that Wushu was the only reason he even wanted to come to Chinese school.  Now if he would only stretch more.

I am gonna skip class tonight and Wednesday.  Kelly is leaving for Texas on Thursday, so I need to hang with her.  Tuesday I am still gonna do the double header, but perhaps I can go to the early wushu class so I can see her for a little while in between wushu and gymnastics.

 Stupid teeth.  If it wasn't for teeth, Kelly would not be going to Texas.  I would not have these holes in the back of my month that constantly catch food.  And we would look funny when we smiled.  Stupid teeth.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Just finished lifting.  The new Cirque TV Show was on tonight.  I got to watch 3 episodes of it.  Too bad I had already seen 2 of them.  I get all excited about it, then i get all worried.  I keep playing out in my head how life will be when I get in and start training. Then I worry about not making it.  Then I think about doing wall backflips or round off - handspring - tuck's.

this would compleatly change my life.  Put me years ahead of the conventional plan.  I would be rid of the cubicle for ever.

Flip spin kick for a living.  By next year.

It's like that time I drempt I had a new sterio.  It was so cool, the greatest sterio I could ever get.  When I woke up I didn't realize it was a dream.  i could not find it anywhere, and i looke every where.  My mom didn't know what I was talking about.  It struck me it was just a dream.  I hope I don't dream cirque.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Well I did a roundoff-backhandspring-backtuck last night.  No, I did have a spotter, and I am crazy inconsistent at it.  This was the second time I attempted the trick so I am not too upset.  I thought I was going to hit it the first time for sure.

Justin Ma was teaching me broadsword last night.  Cleaning up section 3 of the compulsory form.  He really has that form down pat.  Knows his stuff.  Now that I think about it he is one of the better Broadsword people from this country. He really cleaned it up, and it was nice watching him doing stuff broken down for me.

I wanted to go to the advanced wushu class, but I decided that I needed to get my haircut and take the Jeep through the car wash.  That wound up taking until 7:10 or so.  The lady that cut my hair did a horrible job, missed spots on the back and it was all uneven on the sides.  So I took out the clippers and trimmed it my self.  I am pretty proud of the job I did.  I should just get Kelly to cut my hair from now on ' would do a better job than that poor Russian lady.  I felt bad.  She seemed to be taking so much care to do a good job and I looked all lopsided and scraggly.

At least I was able to stop into CVS and get some laundry detergent so that I could impress Kelly when she got home.  Until she called and told me to go to the store and buy some, so I told her I got some already and it wasn't nearly as exciting as surprising her at home.  Don't matter, I guess, since I got some Chocolate Milk out of it.

Taking the evening off to hang with Kelly.  Jeannie is gonna come over and return my camera and do some editing.  She was making this little video for morals or ethics or something for work.  So her group came up with a little skit and they taped it.  I will show her how iMovie works and convert her to Mac for ever!  Buahhaha!  Or just end up editing it to obviate the problem and we can go out to dinner.

Work was fun, I got to spend most of my time today and yesterday playing Model.  Dressed up in Camo with cool helmets and NVG's.  Sure beats the hell out of coding all day.  Now if Kim would tell me what they want out of this Huntsville thing. And IIS would just RUN!! Arrhhgg!

Tomorrow: Long Weapon and a little Gymnastics for good measure.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Kelly is flying to Texas in a few hours to get a temporary bridge put in by her uncle.  Going to be gone all weekend plus a day or two.  Looks like a lonely weekend.  Perhaps I can harass Sean into going up to that game store on Saturday for some Go books.

I am not sure I am gonna make it to wushu on Friday because of over-training injuries.  My lower legs are really getting to be an issue again.  I am worried that they will castigate my training in China.  I had been entertaining the idea of getting some good old western medical help.  I know my general practitioner doctor would tell me to lay off the wushu.  Not an option.  I would like to get referred to a sports specialist or a Kinesiologist, but I don't know how that process works.  Perhaps all my problems would go away if I got orthopedics.  Perhaps it would be a waste of my time and money.  While in Beijing I will jump at any chance to have acupuncture or similar Chinese treatment for the shin pains.

I had the strangest dream last night.  I didn't write it down when I first woke up, so I don't remember much.  But it started with me waking up and getting out of bed ' which was strange and added a powerful realism to the entire experience.  We were getting ready in the morning and going out to our garage (we had a garage!) to get in the car and go to work.  But as the door opened there were some sorta crazy strong and powerful electrical 'disturbance' going on.  We freaked out and it is consuming her car (mine was parked in the garage).  Turns out there was a UFO zapping her car.  You could not see what was going on from in the garage, so I had to poke my head out and around the corner to see it.  Looked like a spherical knights helmet.  I mean, it had a little slit like the eyehole, for the visor.  The bottom hemisphere was a little larger and flared out at the slit.   Don't remember much beyond that other than thinking how annoying it was that the aliens chose to harass my wife's car.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[It was a long weekend all with out a wife.  Hung out with Sean and Josh a lot, and that was fun.  Would have liked to see a few other people also (Dmitry showed up on Friday night), but I don't have any complaints.  At least with these fellas I can play lots of abstract strategy games and every one is happy.

Kelly's dental work reportedly was a success.  No complaints from her other than sore gums.  She has to be careful because this is a temporary thing and is not as strong as the real tooth or the permanent bridge.   I am just happy she is coming home tonight.  I didn't do any laundry the entire time she was gone.  And I am out of underwear now.   Not that I couldn't do it, but it was more a protest thing.  Of course this morning I wanted to clean the house for her return, but I was already late for work when I finally pried my self out of bed.

That'll teach me to stay up till 3 am reading Tolken.

People are starting to ask me to buy them things in china.  I am slightly annoyed at this.  I don't mind getting some stuff for certain people.  But the larger the gifts they ask for the more annoyed I am. Not large like price, but rather size.  Josh mentioned something about how I had to get at least 3 taiji swords: one for me, Gerald and him.  I don't mind getting him one, and it's not like I hardly know him or any thing, but I feel like he is demanding.  I think that is the issue.  It's not so much what they ask, but how.  I am not trying to say it is Josh, but that was just a recent case and it is fresh in my mind.  There have been a number of people that I work hard for and put a lot of my time effort and money into helping them out only to discover that they are happy with my work but don't want to bother doing the same back.

Now I am supposed to write something trite about how in the end it will work out, and God will know and Bla bla blabity-ble.  But c'mon.  I will however decided that I don't give a poo about getting stuff in return and I will do it because I want to.  So take that.

Take?  What should I take'..to china?
Pepto-Bismol, Aspirin, Tylenol PM and Cold/Flu.
2 pairs of jeans.
Sweatpants and wushu pants.
Few dark t-shirts.
Winter coat hat and gloves.
Empty weapons case
In Flight entertainment (Cryptonomicron, Chinese study marterials, Science of sports training)
Lots of extra contacts and toiletries
More'.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Kelly came home last night (YAY!)  Kelly left this morning (*sniff*) Kelly will return tomorrow night (YAY!) But that is not until tomorrow (*sniff*).  She was gone way too long.

You never realize how nice some fresh clean underwear is until you are flipping the dirty nasty smelly ones inside out and trying not to poke out the large gaping holes that have been worn along the seams.

A nice pair of tightie-whities gives me a warms safe and secure feeling.  So sung and comforting.

I was given an 'alternate' task today at work.  It was basically to go fix someone's computer that wasn't playing a movie correctly in one of our trainers.  Everyone seemed to think that this task sucked.  And I guess I sorta played along with that view, but in reality I didn't mind doing it.  In fact I sorta liked it.  Not that the process of actually doing it was fun or enjoyable, or anything along those lines, but it was a relatively easy process and a short-lived task.  So I could do it and get it done. And everyone was happy that I was able to help them out, and I actually accomplished something.

I don't like these big open ended problems.  The complexity of the large projects is overwhelming and makes me uneasy.  I get nervous about the project as a whole.  Not that I can't break it down, but you have to make these design decisions on the break down process that can seem to be a good idea until the very end when they have an Achilles heal that requires a major change.  If the environment is conducive to changes like that it is not so bad (i.e. Java or C++), but perl or asp make for a rotten time.

I think what it boils down to is I would rather work on smaller projects that I can hammer out quickly and be able to say they are done.  You may think that everyone wants this type of work, but according to Kim, he likes to solve problems, and the bigger and more complex they are the more fun it is.  Not sure if I believe this, and he never told it to me directly in so many words.  But it can be pretty easily inferred from his suggestions and daily ramblings.

It's snowing again.  There was a problem on the Blue line today so I decided to drive in, good choice as far as I can tell.  I hope I don't have a revisit to last Thursday's situation:  Make it to wushu, but the snow really comes down and makes driving suck so I can't go to Gymnastics.  I think I am gonna do everything I can to make Gymnastics tonight.  I would skip wushu if I thought that would improve my chances.

I am nervous about going to gymnastics.  Honestly.  I don't want to try and fail the roundoff-handspring-backtuck again.  But I must get it.  So I need to face the fear of crashing (yeah, I got a spotter, but I am more scared of not being able to do it) and smack that beioch into it's place.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I hit roundoff-backhandspring-backtuck last night with out a spot.  Sorta.  I mean, Carlos was there spotting me then he just stopped and stood there incase I needed it.  But he didn't help at all, and I did just fine.  Now all I gotta do is get the guts up to go for it on my own.  Nonetheless I am excited that I actually hit it.

I talked to Qiu Dong Xing for over an hour last night.  He called at 11:30 or so, but Kelly was out of town so I could stay up late and chit chat.  Eventually Qiu Dong insisted that I go to bed.  Sounds like that guy is lonely.  He asked if Kelly and I wanted to move out there after my trip to china.  I said, "move? You mean visit?"  He said "Visit good, move better."  I was flattered that he wanted me to move out there.  Then again he may be thinking that I might actually do it.

He got a job offer teaching wushu, pretty low pay, but they would provide him room.  Unfortunately it was in San Diego, and Tina may stay in LA.  That would suck. Plus he would like to get work in the movies doing stunt work, and San Diego is a little far.  I also talked to Gerald about getting Qiu Dong a job at white tiger, they are pretty expensive and seem to insist on the best and quality stuff, so maybe they would be able to pay him more.  Plus const of living in NC is lower that southern cali.  And it would make it easy for me to go visit ' I bet Gerald would rent them a room cheap.

In my ideal world, I would get the job at Cirque.  And so would Qiu Dong.  Then we could hang out in Vegas and have a good old time.  I need to try and finish his video this weekend.  I am even entertaining the idea of skipping class to get work done on it.

Well I I found out that the power tumbler at capital, Jason (I think, there was also another guy named Chris but I get tem confused), signed on with Cirque.  He doesn't know what or where he is going to do, but mentioned that they offered him a spot on Algeria probably doing fast track.  He would be really good at that.   That kid has the biggest calves.  On of the cheerleaders told me that his calf is so strong that it once ripped his heal off his foot. The entire thing, it was up on his lower leg.  That is just insane.  Of course what do you expect form someone who hits the ceiling at capitol.

Side project:  I think I am gonna try to develop software for tracking scores and other results for martial arts tournaments.  I sent an email to the guy who did the stuff for colligates and I am going to see how he did it.  Perhaps he will want to contribute, or I would be happy just knowing what problems he had.  Eventually I want to make this into software for the entire school system.  Prolly a php-mysql thing.  The first step is the online registration.  The only tricky part is O-Mei cannot take credit cards directly, so we are gonna see about using pay pal.  Looks like those fees will be less than actually signing up for a credit card account with a bank.   Crazy how expensive that stuff is.  It's about a $1.50 per charge.  Paypal will take about that with out any equipment or up front nonsense.  The only problem I can think of is updating our records to see who has paid via pay pal.  I am thinking I may only let people register online if they pay first.  Then on the registration form they must enter the name of the participant on the form.  Any group registration must be done via snail mail and check.  I may have the online form just simply email coach and she will get to keep track of it her self.  I would prefer to make that all automated, but I think that may cause problems if I am the only person who knows how to work it.  So email based system may be better.  I will try to keep a copy on the server to print out reports with ' but I wont let them know of this process or how it would work if I had my may.]]></content:encoded>

I'm all for the old repetition and serious training but 100% against the some of the stupid demands that go with it.

I have seen some fully trained old school coaches demand that you work on your jumping into splits before a proper warm up (unless you consider doing the splits cold a warm up), that's just dumb.  There is no reason anyone should tell the class to partner up and have one of them push the other into splits.  Dangerous enough for a coach to "help" with the stretching, much less your random partner in the yellow belt class.

I think many of the coaches neglect the importance of training physiology.  It seems to me that many of them do not read or study anything to do with sports training or proper ways of doing it.  It's pathetic that "certified" trainers know more about nutrition and exercise sequence than a full-fledged wushu coach.

Of course there are those out there that do the research and learn what is effective and what are misconceptions.  They train you smart and it still works the hell out of you.  Only you don't have as much risk of injuries that will set you back a few years.

Repetition and (the right kind of) Pain are good things.  But there is no reason to be pulling muscles or hyper extending joints in order to get better.  That type of pain only hinders your progress.  That burning sensation I get on full set night is a good pain.  Hurts more than any pulled muscle I have had.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Josh is coming up to meet me for lunch so I figured I would jot a few things down real quick.  We are going to subway.  I have eaten there 3 times this week. At least I get the Turkey sandwich and no chips.  Much better for you than the stuff I used to get there.

I remember a time when Subway was my favorite place.  I used to ask to go there for my birthday.  I'm thinking that was in back when I lived in Cali, but maybe when I still lived in Alaska.  I would insist on Subway (cold cut trio, lettuce, Mustard and Mayo, Salt and Pepper) and a Pie.  I didn't want a cake, only a pie.  Some sorta Chocolate Silk type pie.  Mmmmm, good stuff.

We got a call from Glenn saying that the old USWA peeps wanted to meet up for some chi-fan'ing.  So we went to Unos.  Had lots of people show: Greg, Paulo, Mel, Sean, Glenn, Adrian, Keye, Bryan, Trisha, Philip, Vincent and Kelly and I.  It was cool.  I would up sitting next to Philip, so we were able to talk a bit, we need to hang out with that kid more.  He just lives in that way off far place called Maryland.   There was plenty of old coach bashing going on.  Nothing too serious, but not exactly positive conversation.

I really miss sing those peeps 3-4 times a week.

Josh otta be getting here soon, so I needa post this.  Perhaps some more later today.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I did it for real.  It felt so good.  Finally hit that trick.  Round-off Back-back.

Next is a layout, then a few back handsprings before the flip.

Of course I needed a spot the first few times to get my nerve up, but once that was settled I did it.  I drug Kelly to the gym to show off and impress my woman, but that didn't work so well.  Before Carlos had the time to come spot me I was going Round-off back-handsprings, to which Kelly responded: 'isn't there supposed to be more?  Like a 3rd thing?'

It's my own fault; she would be impressed if I stopped taking her to Jackie Chan movies.

I ordered my evacuation insurance today.  In case of medical disaster they will fly me back to the US.  It is also other medical insurance for while I am in china ' I pretty smart thing to do, IMO.  Set me back $88, but if we had to pay to get my out of china in an emergency it can run over $20K.  Wushu requires medical safety nets, me thinks.

I think I got everything in order for my trip.  Qiu Dong wants me to send him a list of stuff I wanna buy, so he can forward it to his friends to help me gather it up.   So here is a quick brain storm:
<ul><li>Bunch of Straight Swords, preferably nice guiding ones.  I need at least one for Josh, Gerald, Carlos and Matt. </li><li>One nice Taiji sword</li><li>One snappy wushu straight sword</li><li>A Pudao</li><li>A Chain Whip</li><li>A Spear big enough for me (or the parts for one)</li><li>Parts for a 3-Section staff</li><li>small bundle of staffs</li><li>Chop for Mel</li><li>New set of silks, and one for Kelly</li><li>Cool t-shirts (and the like) with crazy Chinese stuff on it</li><li>Feiyue's for Kelly</li></ul>

Think that is about it'I am sure there will be more stuff.  I don't know how this works, having never been to china.  But all anyone ever tells me is how cheap everything is.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Long morning this morning.  I forgot my lunch, and now I am really hungry.  It is almost 3:30, so I will be able to get some food sometime soon.   I had breakfast this morning so I am not blacking out from lack of blood sugar or anything, but I am really hungry.  And sleepy.

Kelly and I stayed up late talking despite our efforts to go to sleep early.  We went from talking about how hard it is going to be being apart for 3 entire weeks to the thickness of the earth's crust.  We debated for a while and had to go wake the computer up and ask google.  Just so you know, it's about 45 km deep.  Strange conversation.  And right now we have no idea what we are going to do to talk to each other while we are apart.  I think Kelly is going to want to talk to me more than will be possible ' but that is true for everyday situations, not just going to china.  Not that I mind, I would sure like her to be there to hear all my stories.

Saturday there was a Sneak Preview for Jackie Chan's <i>Shanghai Knights</i>. But I wound up going to dinner with the in-laws in old town.  Not that it was that bad, it was just no Jackie Chan movie.    At least I had a good 4 hours of wushu before that.

Oh, almost forgot, yesterday was the Superbowl.  Not that I really cared.  We went to Jeannie's Kai's place.  Danny and I spend most of the game debating if we should be watching Figure Skating or a Murder She Wrote Marathon. Then today I found out there was a San Shou fight on ESPN, Chung Le and everything.  Now I know what I shoulda watched.

I'm a bit worried about my ability to handle the training in china.  So much so that I woke up early to go running.  However it was about 10 degrees out side so I decided to jump rope and do a few other exercises instead.  I will lift tonight and might go with Kelly to the little gym to run on the treadmill for a little while.  I also plan on lifting tonight, but I am pretty that I'll skip wushu.  Tonight is a new episode of <i>Cirque Du Soleil: Fire Within</i>.  I guess it doesn't come on till 9, so I could go to wushu and be home in plenty of time.  But I think I need the rest.

I stumbled across Jason(from Capital Gymnastics)'s web page.  He says up there that he trains 20 hours a week.  Really makes me feel like I am not putting the effort into my training that I need to. I really only got about 3 times a week to wushu, and once a week to gymnastics.  Those numbers need to be up by one a week.  I really need to drill the forms and movements to death so I am comfortable with them. I struggle through stuff too much.  Totally unnecessary, if I would simply force my self to master the simple movements and combinations from the forms I would be in much better shape.  Peter could always do that so well.  That Taiji pimp.  (Wish I would hear from him again)

Work to do at work before I can leave for China.  Stupid sitting.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[In the other window I am writing a list of stuff I wanna get in china.  Qiu Dong Xing asked me to send him a list of all that craziness.  I guess so he can give it to his friends to help me out, but most of the stuff I will prolly want to check out before I buy.

But I was thinking about who I should get stuff for while in china:<ul><li>Kelly</li><li>Neal</li><li>My 'Rents</li><li>In-laws</li><li>Nikki</li><li>Gerald</li><li>Laura and Matt</li></ul>

A few others I also want to get stuff for but I am not sure I am gonna be able to.  Mostly it depends on weather or not I have space/money. <ul> <li>Everett</li><li>Jason</li><li>Paulanie</li><li>Sean</li><li>Josh</li><li>Emily</li><li>Philip (he wants silks, kinda a high price/effort request, IMO) </li>
</ul>
BTW, if you are not on the required list, don't be offended, that list is pretty much all family.  They just get priority.  I plan on doing a bunch of shopping while I am there.  One tricky thing is I don't know how much money to take along.  Or how hard it is going to be to get the money while I am there.

'

Ok, I just wrote a few emails, on to Morgan (the guy setting up the trip) and one to Tina with the stuff that QDX asked for.  Man, I am getting all psyched up.  Makes working so much harder.

On to a totally unrelated subject:  Laughter.   Kelly and I have discussed how much little kids laugh.  They will seriously just go running down the hallways laughing as hard as they can simply because it is fun to see everything bouncing by.  This has got to be the best thing for you ever.  Not only does it rip the stress from your being, but it is great exercise.  Adults simply don't' run down halls laughing enough.

Kelly did point out that when we do run around for no reason other than running around we tend to giggle and laugh as we do it.  This is good.  We just don't do that enough.

Adults are simply way to self conscious about that.  I cant do it at work because that would be considered unprofessional.  Not like that stops me from doing body turns or stretching at my desk.  But that stuff is subdued enough that it doesn't attract negative attention to me'.but subdued enough to also lack the amazing powers that the laughter and joy of more uncontrolled activities would have.

Going to gymnastics again tonight.  Going to try that roundoff-handspring-tuck again.  I think I am going to have Carlos spot me for the first time so I can convince my self that I will be fine.  I get nervous about it still.  However last Thursday was crazy fun.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Well, Carlos is going to be gone until after I leave for China, so if I want to do any tumbling I will A) not have a spotter (not so bad) and B) be at the gym with out a coach (a little worse).  Carlos said he would tell Sergio that I am coming to workout tonight when the power tumblers are there, but I am not sure I want to do that.  Then again it could be a good month before I get to try the new stuff again.   I am being indecisive, and I really should just go and do it.  What I am worried about (other than a broken ankle)?

Finally talked with Mark about QDX's web page.  I met him once when I was in Arizona for Li Jen Heng's Wushu tournament.  My old coach from USWA introduced us, but that was more like a 'oh, hi--ok, bye' type meeting.  Seems like a cool guy, now that I have actually talked, er--chatted with him. Hopefully we can get this web page stuff for Qiu Dong done soon (that, and the video).  You know with a trip to china and all that craziness.

Kelly and I are a little worried about cash this time of year.  Paying off Christmas and all.  We always spend more than we should for Christmas.  I know that is normal and expected of us in our culture ' but we try to actually plan for it and set aside what we need.  I guess multiple plane tickets to Texas and a few to China and Vienna don't make our budget any easier to control.  The low on cash thing makes it even more annoying when people ask me to bring them stuff back form China.  No offence people, but I swear EVERYONE is asking me to do that.  And some people are being demanding about it -- which only makes it much worse.  C'mon people, this is my first trip.  Let me figure out how things work THEN we can talk about stuff for my to buy you (especially those people who may or may not pay me back, you know who you are).  Arg.  OK.  That is not a good topic and I have written about it too much so no more -- out of my system.

I wanted to write something deep and/or profound, but I gotta do real work now.  That's what I get for getting stumped then distracted. Dang.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Yeah, I am a wuss.  And I don't know why.  I have always been.  I don't ever 'Go for it.'  I always build up to stuff slowly.

The incident that inspired this train of thought was my lack of backtuck last night.  The round-off and back-handspring were just fine.  But I never got the balls to tack that last flip on.  It's not like I wouldn't make it or it would even be close.  I am certain I would.  But then I think about it too much and don't go for it.

Nothing new.  When I was skating, I would always build up to stuff.  There are advantages to this.  I practiced on a rail that was 6 inches off the ground so much that when I finally jumped up onto a handrail height rail I would be able to stay on easy and balance much better than a lot of the more advanced skaters.  The biggest disadvantage: slow.  It would take me forever to get that big trick.  Once I built up to it, I had overanalyzed it and knew everything about it, but in the end that was much more info than necessary.   On the up side I have never had any injuries worse than a nasty bruise or hearty scrape.

Putting that backtuck after the round-off back-handspring and doing a wall flip.  I drilled the hell out of that stuff.  Never had any remotely close calls.  Always been consistent.  Dagnabbit, wuss.

Of course now it is gonna be a clean month before I can go to gymnastics again.

So I talked to a number of people that said when I go to china I should just take cash.  Apparently $300 should be plenty for a month (my room and board are paid for), but $500 is more than enough to be safe.  Hmmm.  Maybe I will get some travelers checks just to be safe.  I need to remember to ask Qiu Dong about money when I call him -- or if I see Ted online.

A week from tomorrow I am going to be on a plane.  People keep asking me when I am leaving.  I have made it a habit to reply 'The 8th, you wanna go?'  So far no one says yes.  I have had a few 'Yes, but''s, but those don't count.

I wish I could bring my PS2 on the plane, I love Vice City.  Such a fun game.  It's even fun to watch someone play.  A combination of the radio stations and crazy funny stuff that happens to you -- and that you make happen to innocent bystanders.

Going to see the Recruit tonight, then play poker over at Jeannie's place.  Should be fun.  I hope I can convince Sean to come ' I haven't seen him in over a week.  However we may be going to some Chinese New Year thing on Saturday with him.  I just don't know any details about it right now.

Oh, Jason may come up this weekend; he wants to go fine some Xin Nian festivities.  Unfortunately I don't know of any other than a few wushu demos.  The O-Mei one sounds like more traditional fun-ness, with a dragon dance and wushu, but that is a restaurant, so I don't know if it is open to the public.  The USWA one is in lake forest mall again, but that is kinda westernized new year show (it's in a mall!! There was line dancing last year!).  I was kinda disappointed that no one at O-Mei asked me to demo.  I will pretend that they thought I had left already (I know Stephan thought I was gone), plus I couldn't do the one last weekend because of Chinese school.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Socks.  Socks of all things.  Well I would have never thought of that on my own.  I was talking to Qiu Dong last night and he was giving me advice on stuff to bring to china.  He suggested I bring along some gifts to give people over there.  Girls were easy, they like candy and chocolate, but the guys would prefer socks.  Nice brand name ones apparently.  That and T-Shirts.  I figure I will make a run up to target or sports authority and get 2 or 3 cheap, but brand name, shirts and a package or two of Adidas socks.

I also need to pick up a power converter today.  But that is pretty much all I am gonna need to get for China.  5 days sounds really short.  I have a feeling that it is going to take forever.

Kelly is getting nervous.  I can tell her worrying it getting to her when she randomly run to the bathroom and hugs the toilet and prepares for emptying her stomach.  Now, that sort of thing worries <b>me</b>.  I am sure she will be fine, she just doesn't know what to expect, and I don't know what I am going to be doing or where I will be or how I will talk to her.  Well, I have a good idea, but nothing that we can set in stone and be our pre-determined plan.  If there is one thing my wife likes it is a set-in-stone-plan.  I blame that short bald man--her father.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Well, Jason came up this weekend.  He wanted to see something Chinese for Lunar New Year.  I found a big parade in china town to take him to, but he wound up wanting to leave earlier than that would allow, so we went to an O-Mei Demo that was at Maxim Palace Chinese restaurant.  There was some sort of large Chinese organization having a banquet there, so Jason and I sat in the back and waited for the demo.  I wound up having to make a last minute run back to the school go get a music CD, so I was at least useful.

Before the demo we went to A&J's for dinner and introduced Jason to some 'Dao di zhong guo fan.'  Watching him eat with chopsticks was pretty fun.  Overall Jason seemed a little sad.  I am thinking his wompthy demeanor was due to his woman dissing him.  I don't really know what the deal is with that yet, I didn't wanna bring it up and make things worse.  I do know he kept running up stairs to check if she was online ' never seen Jason hung up on a girl like this.

I think Kelly talking to him was more useful than I was.  I always avoid subjects that get too personal like that.  I would much rather talk about body functions and crazy adventures than feelings and love.  Defense mechanism I guess.  I wonder if it relates to staying in a safe personal space with people.  Even people I have known for years I pretty much avoid all body contact with them ' tend to wave good-bye when standing clearly with in handshake distance.  So awkward.  This is why I am determined to try and shake hands with people when I first meet them.  Set the precedent and enjoy a relationship free of awkward handshake-less good-bye's.

Luckily I don't have any problem with that sorta thing with Kelly.

One very down point to this weekend was the Space Shuttle.  Jason arrived and asked if I had heard the news.  I hadn't.  He said there was an accident with the space shuttle Columbus.  I immediately turned on the news to find out what was going on.  Jason gave me a quick run down.  I called upstairs to Kelly who was slowly waking up.  I knew she was going to take if very hard, she still talks about challenger.  I told her and she broke out in tears before I could finish.  We sat around staring at the TV as they showed clips of the shuttle breaking up on reentry.   After about an hour I pulled my self away to go to wushu and be distracted, I left them sitting there blankly looking at the news.  By the time I returned Jason was more than half way through Shaolin Soccer and it's crazy antics brought our sprits up.   We still noticed the flags all across the city that were at half-mast. My only hope is that NASA will get some additional funding for manned space flight and we can get some new technology flying.  Of course this could go the other way and cause cuts that cripple our already lame program.

Perhaps China sending a man in space will get us going.  Better yet would be if they could put someone on the moon or the like.  We need someone to compete with.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Taxes suck.  I made a little mistake that is causing me 5 grand.  Kelly and I thought we were doing everything right and we were being good.  We really tried to play by the rules but I followed the directions on the W-4 form correctly and got screwed.  Agghhhh!

Basically we took fewer deductions this year because we owed 2 grand last year and didn't want that to happen again.  Well, turns out that I checked the Married box on my W-4 when I started work at DCS.  I didn't do this when I was at IMAKE because I wasn't married when I started ' then when I got married I changed my deductions to 1, with out changing the married status.

Well, apparently, if you check Married you things will be withheld at a lower rate.  Makes sense if married people paid less tax ' but no!  There is a marriage penalty.  A big one.  We would be getting over five hundred back (EACH!) if we were single and living together, but instead we owe five frikkin grand.

To top it off our brokerage company doesn't send us 1099 forms like they are supposed to, instead we get these supplemental and div forms.  With these weird ass date ranges and everything.  You know I wanted to give them my money, and be honest and up front about it.  I would let them take it when they wanted.  But the man cannot even do that right.

There goes all the money (plus some) that I wanted to blow in china (and for Kelly to blow in Europe).  Sucky suck suckarama.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Day after tomorrow. Coming down to it, I will be in china this weekend.  Crazy fun time.  I can hardly believe it ' I am finally truly excited now.  I will sneak off to china and return a wushu master!  Well, at least I will get better, that's for sure.  Hopefully more betterness than I would get just staying here.  I have high expectations of the gains I will get, but will be happy just practicing my Chinese and not going to work for 3 weeks.

My bags are mostly packed.  I do need to remember to put socks in my bag. I will go to the bank today and get a big wad of cash.  My biggest concern is still weather or not my lower legs can take it.  Stupid shin splints.  They don't' hurt now, but after a good chang quan class I really feel it.  Hmmm, I wonder how hard it will be to get ice there.

Kelly was stressing when she got home last night, originally it was about work, but she was able to transition it over into stress over my trip. She was worried about me making it through customs in Detroit and missing my flight ' making me have to pay large sums of money to get it fixed.  She worried about me losing that large wad of cash, or having it stolen while I sleep on the plane.   You know that sorta stuff.  After talking about it for some time and with a certain level of vigor we wound up calling Northwest Airlines and asking them what the deal for a few of the in-transit issues.

1) There are 2 types of customs: In Travel and a Destination. Normally the line for the people that are just passing through the country is open and you just walk on through.  It only gets tight when you arrive wherever you are going.
2) If you miss a flight because of a delay or the like that was the fault of the airlines they will fix it.  Even post 9/11.
3) If you miss a flight because of customs or other requirements the airlines have no set policy for dealing with it, however they will probably help you out.  According to the lady at NWA.

So it looks like I should be just fine.  People do this every day.  As long as I can avoid the China Whammy I will be a happy guy.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Tomorrow, tomorrow!  I am all packed up and ready to go.  I got all sorts of medicine and vitamins and clothes and ' well, that's pretty much what I am bringing.  I will check my giant TKD bag and a weapons case with one sword in it (I decided to take my gui ding jian).  Gonna carry on my backpack which has my camera bag and some books in it; and my Timbuktu bag for a change of clothes toiletries and contacts stuff.

Every one kep suggesting stuff for me to bring.  Of course I had a few people remind me (ARG!) to buy them stuff.  Never a 'if you don't mine' or 'as long as it's easy', but rather a don't' forget to buy lots of stuff for me.  At least Josh offered to pay.  Emily provided me with one of the afore mentioned phrases, so I am gonna look for some size 37 feiyue's for her'.can't for get Kelly is a size 38.

Speaking of that, I asked Kelly what size she wore her feiyues in, and she responded with 'Why, I don't do wushu any more'.  That was very sad.  I always thought she had intended to return sometime in the future, we just were not sure when.  I guess it is fine if she doesn't ever wanna come back, but it would be nice.  I swear she would like xingyi or bagua, but she swears she hates them.  I am not sure she knows what they are (other than 'what Jet Li did in <i>the one</i>).  Sadness.

Who cares!  She still likes sword, and I am going to China!  Of course I really wish she would come with me, and I plan on knocking her over the head, stuffing her in the TKD bag (she will fit, no problem) and taking her with me ' but I think it would be a better situation if I paid for a ticket for her and we had a valid visa.  Hmmmm.  Damn.

I really need to sneak out of the office for a little while to go up to target and get some razor cartridges, I only have 2, and that is kind of tight for 3 weeks.  Not like a actually need to shave.  I have the facial hair of a square watermelon.  And trust me, that is not a lot.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Just a quick post.  I have been making a serious hand written journal and hopoefully I can type all that up and post it up here in a blatent flaunting of something or other.  But I figured it would be cool to have a least one message posted from china.  Hopefully I can make my way to the internet cafe and get another one or two up.

China is cool.  it consists mostly of th following: Serious training with the Beijing team (I am the ONLY wai guo ren here this week) and missing my wife.  The missing of my wife is more difficult than the training.  I was only sore for the first 4-5 days but the whole no-wife-ness only gets worse.  Tomorrow I should be able to talk to her on the phone, and I jsut wrote her a long rambling email professing my love so it may get better soon.

Beijing is a pretty cool place.  I have met a bunch of cool people.  All the gory detials have been painfull hand wirtten in my journal (I am so much slower with a pen and paper, and my hand cramps up -- ahh typing), so I will type that up later.

If you see my wife, tell her I love her.  If you have any news email me -- I am in a bubble here no idea of anything going on outside of the Shi Cha Hai.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Still in china.  I got about a week to go.  I am finally getting into the swing of things.  I am keeping up with the team better and better these days.  Not in terms of level -- in that frame of refrence I am way behind -- but as far as keeping up with the workout and not getting sore.  I sleep alot more here than i do in the States.  Part of that is because of the training and part is because I have more time with less destractions.  I like having less distractions.  None of that tedious going to work crap or the like.  I basically have no side projects that i need to deal with.  Just training and sleeping.  The occational shopping and/or sight-seeing.

China is a much better place once you learn how to do things like go to a little store and get a drink and a snack.  That first week i had no idea what was going on.  My chinese was plenty good to deal with situations like that, but i was intimidated and never actually tried.  In reality I was probably just rolling around in my own self pity at the time and didn't want my situation to get better.  ... Well, now that i really think about that, that is not compleatly true: maybe 50% true.  I also didn't want to be embarrased.  Stupid pride.

Beijing has alot of very interesting places.  The Summr palace.  Shi Cha Hai. This smoky internet cafe. Wang Fu Jin.  I would really like to stay here and learn mroe chinese and train for longer if i could.  Mind you that "if I could" includes a very important detail, beisdes money, i would have to drag my wife along.

Even with the the fun and cool things to do around here I don't think I could take if for more than a semester or so.  At least a semester at a time.  Being here really makes me like the place i live.  That mid atlantic reagon is a nice place as far as I am concerned.  I know I coudl also be happy on the west coast or northeast, but I think mid-atlantic is my favorite place.  Of course I have little to compare it to.  I have seen alot of the US but very little of the world.  I need ot make a serious point to remedy that.  Even if i only can go out and prove that I like the place I came from.

Ok, I know I am rambling.  I dont have any place I am going with this entry.  I should really sit down and decide what I want to write about and give my log some sort of focus.  I don't know if I do abetter job with pen and paper or not.  Mostly I think every thought through and have a fully composed monologue in my head but before I can get it on paper I get distracted.

So I quick view on two important issues on my mind:  Training & Cirque.

Well really they are the same thing.  Most of my training these days is to get ready for Cirque.  I am learning Pu Dao and 9 section whip mostly for cirque (and because i think they are cool).  I can't really learn them from the peeps at Shi Cha Hai per se, but Morgan is teaching me after class type thing.  Or during the classes that the coach dosent show up to.  (Those are great.  It's like a little open gym with the beijing team.)  But I figure I otta get some viraty under my belt before the audition. I know I need to concentrate on 3 events for team tryals but I think it would help set me out and get attention if I wasnt doing the same weapons that everyone else is.

Most of last week was conditioning in the afternoons and a little tao lu practice in the evening -- more conditioning than forms.  I would really prefer it to be the other way around, but it is sorta off season for these kids and time for them to get in to good shape.  However I get little from that sort of training at this time.  When I do train forms I mostly do sword.  A little chang quan and no staff (so far).  Only today did I even buy a staff.  I got 3.  However I intend to make one of those into a spear -- maybe something else to pick up after team tryals.

So far training here (aside from the time running and conditioning) is very similar to what we do back home.  They will spend more time on each specific skill the pratice in basics -- for example we regularly train tornados for 15 min and butterflys for 15 min.  But they also do fewer basics all together.  Often we will compleatly skip jump front kicks (even though we do the jump-with-out-the-kick warm ups for them. No one is in a big hurry to get things moving through basics and onto the more meaty part of class (be it conditioning or forms).  Of course this has alot to do with the amount of time they have to train.  A couple of 3 hour session a day are a big diffrence from on class a night (and that is alot) back home.  The format of the class is pretty much the same.  Right down to the actual skills we drill.  Of course when we are doing front sweeps they all go around 2 or 3 times to my one.  Same for tornados.  But then I will get a good happy feeling when I see that i can out butterfly a number of the team members (remember I train with the b-team).   I honestly feel that a few weeks is going to make a diffrence in my level -- but i think that I am just now mature enough (in my wushu) for it to do so.  In a few years it would probably be even more helpful.  I know there are alot of good people in the US wushu scene, even at my school, but I feel as I get closer to that celing that the US atheleates hit immersing my self in the training with people that are a much higher level makes a noticeable diffrence.  At least to the person doing the training.  I don't know if anyone back home will be able to tell that i have changed or improved but I know that I have.  I jsut view things diffrent now.  I see how things are supposed to be done.  What should be fast and powerful what dosent really matter.  Another frame of refrence adjustment.

However I hope the diffrences that are made are improvements that the recruiters at the Cirque audition will notice.  This little event is much more important to me than team tryals.  The team tryals are pretty much a novilty at this point.  I woudl really really like to make it, but I don't really know if it is within my reach or not.  I think I can go to any US wushu competition and not be embarrassed right now, but i don't know if I could get to the point that I could win them with authority (as opposed to some blind luck/faith/mistake in my favor) .  Cirque is a diffrent story.  I have only been doing wushu for a few years (3 this Aug.), but I have been doing martial arts related acrobatics all the way back to when I was in middle school.  The front yard of my house back in san berdo -- jason myers and i would flip each other, do dive rolls, spin kicks, chorograph fights.  That was the start of the path that lead to skating and to Tang soo do and to TKD and gymnastics and so on.  In college gerald adn i really wanted to get more advanced stuff.  We did the best with what we had and it really started my serious effort towards preformance -- something like cirque.  It is everything I coudl possably want in that relm of my life.  Martial arts.  Acrobatics.  The entire package.  Much more pressure than something like team tryals.  Of course I gotta stop thinking of it like that or I will blow it out of proportion.  It is nice right now because Morgan also is goign through the same thing.  His audition was back in december in LA.  Now he is being called out to come reaudition in NYC with me (nice to have a friend there too).  I am wondering if it is because they now have seen more wushu and know what they are looking for or what.  We spend alot of time talking about it and speculating about the details like pay, the basic training they do before you sign a contract, and the audition process.  At least I have a bit more insite for what to expect in the audition now.   I got to play my wide varity of talents right.  There are alot of big name peeps that showed up the the Vegas audition -- He Jing De, the Hsu sisters, a number of the older big US wushu names.  But how many of them can tumble?  or have played on a trap as much as I have?  Not that i have great skill in either, but a little training I could be up to speed in no time.  And i have a month to get ready.  Just wish I knew where I should be going with my training.  But then again I am sure that the cirque peeps don't even know what they want yet.  Prolly I should work on my acting, dance and improv skills more than anything.

Current focus:  Clean up and tighten down straight sword.  Add speed and power to staff (I know where I jstu need to put it into pratice).  Drill that tumbling pass to death.  And pick up enough pudao and 9 section whip that I can do a few sections at the audition.

Of course I need to fit this all in with catching up on some serious time with the wife.  I love that girl.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Crazy day today.  We went to pratice in the morning.  Which I am now able to do with the A-Team.  No, not Mr. T and the rest of the gang, but the cool A Team (I already regret that joke.  I'm sorry).  I am actually really happy that James and Nadir and Suzanne are here now.  Not that I wasnt getting hooked up nicely, but they have friends in higher places and are getting a nicer treatment than a guy off the street.  Last week I was asking a few people if I could video the class and was getting 'prolly not' as a reply.  But James asked for me and we got a "No problem!" and two thumbs up form Coach Cui.  Turns out that James is a EE -- in addition to the whole wushu thing, nice guy to boot.  At first I was a little depressed because I felt like my first two weeks were a waste.  That I had thrown away alot of my time and effort because I was being cramed in with Coach Lu and his boys.  The guy is a cool guy, crazy, but I think he is cool.  But he didn't really care about me and my goofy 'merican wushu.  I see a few peeps waltz in from cali and get hooked up.  Part of it is their ability to speak chinese (nadir can't, but with suzanne's help he communicates just fine).  This self pity/hostility goes on for that first night, but then I realize that I did get lot form my training.  If my chinese was better I would have been hooked up more -- so what if I could
have gotten a little more out of the deal.  It's been a good trip -- plus with the help of James I am gonna train with Liu Qing Hua for the next two days.  Her, and another ex-team member (yi chang, I think) really put effort into smacking us into line.  I really appreciate that.  It would be so much easier for them to say "faster, higher, more power" and take care of their full time students.

Oh, today we went to the great wall.  Quite an adventure.  First, we didn't knwo how to get there.  Our expert on beijing, Morgan, had never been.  Tucker had but it hadnt been for a while.  We had tried to get a guy form a cab company but he wouldnt answer the phone.  So we haild a cab, hop in and say "we wanna go to the great wall of china!" like a bunch of american dorks.  He basically says "hell no! That's way too far!".  We get out.  Tucker gives a chinese friend of his a call and she says that we will have to find a 1.60 cab and work out a deal (we almost alwasy take the cheap -- go-cart like 1.20 cabs).  So we hail the next cap, a nice and yellow 1.60 one (almost all the cabs here are red).  He says 'Nope.'  At this point we were thinking we werent gonna be making it today.  And the weather was so nice!  But then, sitting like a shining red gift from God -- at the intersection in front of the Shi Cha Hai was a 1.20 cab -- morgan cracks open the door and see's if he is game.  He is!  great fun.

So off to Badaling in a rickety 1.20 cab, who's driver's breath reeks of some sort of nasty garlic sausage.

After an hour or so and one false stop we got there.  The one false stop was pretty interesting.  Wrong part of the wall.  so we backed up the on ramp and went back on the free way.  Only in china.

Was was fun.  I will put the pictures up when I get back into the states.  Lots of wandering around.  I made Tucker take my picture doign a Au Batido in all sorts of crazy places.  In some places it is steep.  Insane.  We even made a unofficial detour off the regular tour.  We snuck past one of the pay bathrooms and ran otu onto the hills.  A frantic chinese lady yelling HELLO!!! as mean as she could.  We ignored her and kept walking -- a skill I have learned works well with the people trying to sell you stuff.  At this point we decieded that if we were persued by and official types we would only speak english.  Paly the dumb american card I guess.  But it was uneventful, and we were able to walk around and get back on the wall.  We didn't make it to the cable car to the bottom before it closed -- so we wound up taking a strange rollercoaster type thing.  Basically like a little cars on a track that took you to the bottom of the hill.  Kinda took up to the wrong part of the bottom of the hill, but we got to see the bears.  Yep.  Black bears in concreate pits.  Eating poradge.   It was like a chinese zoo type thing that was being built.   For some reason they decided that they needed to hurry up and get the bears there.  Some of those bears were crazy fat -- and just laying there slurping on their poradge.  It was very sureal.  I guess there must have been some debate on what to feed these bears at the chinese zoo society when someone whipped out a copy of goldie locks and the three bears.  The result was a few concreate pits with odd jungle gym type contraptions (for the skinny bears to climb on) and a bunch of very large fat bears eathing poradge out of concrete troths.

Eventually we found out cabbie who was waiting for us -- meter running and took us home with out incident.  Pretty fun adventure.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[You know I am picking up two optional weapons right now.  I wanted to get at least one under my belt -- and I need to learn a number of them even if I dont plan on actually training it and trying to get it to competition level.  Pudao is mostly cool because noone does it.  But It lacks the flair and crazy coolness that chain whip has.  Plus Kelly really likes chain whip -- she really wants me to learn it.  I will prolly ocncentrate on it when I return the the states.  However I havent learned any of the the form -- but I have some video of Morgan walking through it and a nifty little VCD for how to do it.  I do know the pudao form -- at least 3 sections of it.  Not a very cool form.  Kinda rigid and unexciting.  I will see if I can get Qiu Dong Xing to help me with it when he comes to VA in march.

You know here at Shi Cha Hai you can't really "learn" new forms.  I mean, it is possable to convince someone to show you.  But the coaches dont' really teach new stuff to people.  If the athleates want to learn a new taolu they go out and buy a VCD or get a buddy to show them the form.  The pratice that till they can do sections and the coach will just correct them.  I guess it dosent really matter once you get to their level -- but it is a pretty stark contrast to how most martial arts on the US are taught.  However i guess alot of wushu has been taught to me that way.  When I decided I needed to learn the B-Sword Compulsory Form Lu Xiao Lin just assigned a few people to show me.  Once I got it form them she watched and corrected me.  The only diffrence is when I asked her she found a student to help me.  When I asked Coach Lu (b-team) he said that he couldnt teach me.  Of course is may have told me to try and go find someone or to buy a VCD, but I didn't understand.  Gotta work on my chinese -- I would help my wushu so much.

I pretty much decided that I really do like chain whip. I mean, I knew I wanted to learn it the first time I saaw phillip do the form -- and kelly wanted me to picked it up once she saw it.  She seems to think I would be really good at it or something.

Crazy Girl.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Back from China.  Still a little jet lagged, but I seem to recover form it pretty fast.  I think I recovered from it faster out in china because I was working out twice a day and that would wake me up and get me going.  Wushu always has a way of getting me wired.  I was much more aware of this fact while I was in China.  I also have realized that the late wushu classes I go to here in the US are not the best for my sleeping habits.  They get me all awake and unable to sleep for a few hours.

Well it looks like Qiu Dong will not be coming to VA this month.  He was supposed to be staying with me this weekend but he is doing a movie so he can't make it to Charlie Lee.  I may go out there because he wants me to go fine Yi Ling and say hi (she is the BJWT girl that is now at CMAI).  Plus Gerald may be headed up for it ' so I will prolly drop in and check things out during the day.  I don't plan on competing, and I am not really sure that it is worth the money to go watch or not.  It would be purely social reason for going, if I did go.  I'll have to check who all is planning on going and make a decision on that. It is good that QDX is not coming, in a way ' my parents wanted to bring the entire clan (sisters and their bunch of peeps) and come visit on Sunday.  I got presents for the lot of them.  It will be nice to see them all.

I think I am gonna take tonight off from wushu and spend just a little more time with my wife.  I seems silly to no go, however.  I mean it is just a measly little hour of training.  I will have a serious day tomorrow with gymnastics in addition to wushu.   I plan on hitting up class Tuesday through Friday, Saturday for the tourney.

Well I needa go take care of work things.  I will put more up about my trip later.  I would like to either type up or scan in the pages from my journal and post them up here.  Makes for good safe keeping of my thoughts.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[You know I was thinking about what I had learned while I was in china.  Not just the wushu related knowledge but other more general aspects of life.  I had a lot of time to my self.  That entire first week I could not get in contact with my wife, didn't know where an internet caf' was, and knew a total of zero people who spoke English (zero people that were actually at Shi Cha Hai, Tucker was in town -- but was very busy with his job).  This lead to a lot of time thinking, reading and writing in my journal; which had the side effects of lonely home sickness and self pity.  I realized part of why this happened today on my way to lunch.

I was driving to go get some lunch, and I had planned on going and getting some burgers at Fudruckers.  But as I was walking out to get in the car and driving down there I thought of trying out that little BBQ Place, Kenny's.  I have wanted to try it out even since I first discovered it ' which was probably the first week I actually was working here (so about a year ago).  But I havn't been.  Why?  Because I get nervous about just going in.  No real reason why I am shy about walking through the door and getting me some nice pit cooked meat ' but I am.  Same feeling I got back when I was hesitant about going into the gymnastics club, or into wushu for the first time.  Really, what are they going to say?  No you can get BBQ here (or no wushu, no flipping, etc).  This spooked feeling has been present for as long as I can remember ' going into any unknown situation.

It was an issue while I was in China.  I often would lie awake at night hungry.  But less then 100 feet from the front gate of Shi Cha Hai was a little shop that would be happy to sell me a snack.  I just didn't know how it worked.  Eventually Morgan returned and was able to show me around ' however I would not have needed his assistance if I would have had the gumption to simply go out and do what I needed.  At the time I blamed it on my lack of Chinese skills ' but in hindsight I can see that my Chinese was plenty good for those situations.  Plus I don't have any language barrier excuses when it comes to getting some BBQ for lunch.

This issue gets me thinking, I have a feeling a lot of other people out there have this same apprehension for walking into places.  It would explain why fast food is so popular.  I mean, the food is horriable for you, dosent taste that great, poor atmosphere and service ' but everyone goes there.  Maybe not  as an everyday meal, but when you are traveling you instinctively look for that fast food chain you know and go there.  McDonalds (or Burger king or Taco bell) are all the same everywhere.  I was able to walk into McDonalds in Beijing and get a Big Mac by pointing to a nice little picture of it.  If I wanted super size, I point to a picture of a big frys and coke.  But the problem I see with this is what happens if you want to get a business running and don't want to buy into a franchise?  Say a wushu school?  This is going to call for some serious thought into the exterior appearance of said school.  It has to scream 'Come on in, check the place out' to the casual onlooker.  This is not so easy to do if you put the school in a warehouse or in the back ally of a strip mall.  But of course those places are the cheapest locations that could support such a school. Koryo's Location is ideal.  This TKD school is in a little shopping center ' not like a full out strip mall, but rather a building that has maybe three or four shops.  Koryo takes up and entire side of the building, maybe 1/3 of the total space.  There is a day care or the like on the opposite side and a hair salon or restaurant or whatever decided to move in to the other location.  Good amounts of parking and lots of windows.  It has a very clean nice welcoming appearance to it.  The sign is not like a painted board or a cheap back light sign ' but rather each separate letter is lit form the inside.  Nice clean colors.  A lot of martial arts schools pile nasty looking trophies (prolly the single most shoddy manufactured product to come out of Taiwan), a homemade looking sign,  and no real area for walk-in's to wait and look.  I am not sure where all this is going, but I do know how important it is to figure out what specific queues people pickup and associate with 'familiar' and 'inviting'.  I am gonna go think about this and do my brainstorming before I write about it here.

Not as trivial as I originally thought.

Looks like Gerald is going to be up here for sure this weekend.  Coming in Friday evening.  I am planning on having some of the old wushu peeps over to my place for a little dinner and some Hero.  I am beginning to think I ought to extend the invitation to the non-wushu fellas.  It just has a little uncalled for awkwardness about it ' but I do want to see people like Josh and Dmitry and Duanne.   Oh, I will have to remember to ask Kyle tonight at gymnastics if he is working on Friday night.  Prolly is, being in the restaurant biz.  I'll run it by Kelly, because she gets stuck playing host whenever I invite people over.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Went to wushu for the first time since returning from China, it was pretty good.  The advanced class was rather small.  A total of 7 people actually.  The Funny thing is that the old uswa'ians out numbered the people that weren't.  Sorta tells you something.  But I shouldn't go there.

I skipped gymnastics.  I was just so sleepy.  It has been about 4 days since my plane landed, but I sill am not adjusted.  I am getting better.  I was able to stay up till 11 or so and the led me to sleeping in to a nice late 7:10.  I do like getting into work earlier then the boss and most of the co-workers, but my old schedule depends on so many late classes.  At O-Mei the wushu classes don't run too late, just till 8pm officially, but it is pretty easy to be there past quarter of nine.  Which isn't bad at all, but gymnastics can last till 11 on Tuesdays.  Which is why last night when I was tired at 8 decided that I really otta just skip.

It was a little strange, but now that I am back Lu Xiao Lin seemed a little more attentive to me and my sword form.  She seemed to give me more corrections in more detail.   Liu Qing Hua and Li Quiang corrected a bunch of stuff saying that I was doing it totally wrong.  But I noticed that was mostly my fault (i.e. not LXL, everyone else in class seemed to be doing the form just fine). Some of the movements I didn't actually get until I had a few weeks to work on the changes I got in china and was able to come back here and have LXL straighten out the new errors I was making as a result of the China modifications.

One of the major changes is in section 3, after the inside kick -- sword circles -- there is a chop back and a flower overhead.  Well before on the flower overhead I was stopping at a strange position.  Turns out this strange position was actually part of the movement, just not the stopping point ' so I was leaving out the rest of the flower.  LQH corrected the movement and had me finish it, and LXL pointed out that I was rushing the now-complete movement and I need to open my chest up and throw my head back.   It is stuff like this that needs to happen for improvements to be made now at this point in my wushu.

Plus we spent a while with Stephan, Emily and Sara working on some flavor stuff.  And Coach Lu fixed our 'sword-circles' thing.  I gotta remember there is the one big circle and that you drop all the way down into a cross stance then two smooth and smaller (not fast and tiny) circles before the backward chop.  I am pretty sure my wushu has a somewhat bland or mildly salty flavor.  I want a nice tangy spicy taste.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Disclaimer: the first part of the log is political babble. You really otta skip down past it.

I really didn't wanna go and write political commentary.  But I do want to write about what I think about.  It's one thing to hear the media drone on and on from one skewed point of view, spinning every story in order to get more viewers/readers.  But I have read in a number of peoples blogs what looks like very well thought out arguments on why Americans are so bad.  Not just over the Attack Iraq thing, but they seem to be drawing much broader assumptions.  Plus, on top of this, being grilled by Chinese people over why are we bullying Iraq.

Well first, China didn't seem to mind when we were 'bullying people' out of China (Japanese) and helping unify the country.

A lot of people out there seem to hang tightly to the fact that the US is not getting the blessing of the UN.  But as far as I can find the UN has only given it's stamp of approval on 2 major actions: N. Korea invading South, and the first Persian Gulf war.  According to the UN it self, both of these were flukes.  The Korea thing went down during the cold war and the Soviets were boycotting the UN Security Council ' so their veto didn't happen.  The Persian Gulf War had a strange timing at the beginning of the 90s, right after the Cold War ended, and every nation with that big veto status was still on such a high that they didn't try to stop the military action from pushing Saddam out of Kuwait.  Even though Saddam was blatantly invading another country, there was some last minute opposition to the invasion (ahem, France).

Other than those two cases there have been many unsanctioned invasions by all the other veto wheedling countries.  France and England invaded Egypt. Russia stomped all over the Czechs and Hungarians.   I think even Germany tried to invade a few countries.  I could find a big long list, plenty of smug, superior nations opposing a regime change have done it them selves plenty of times, and not with any approval of any UN Security Council or league of nations or anyone but them selves.  I am sure that ALL of these regime changes were for some sort of self-interest.

A lot of this people that say their country is so bad seem to hang on the issue that the US just wants lots of Oil.  No one seems to point out that the opposition to the war could simply be countries looking out for their own self-interest.  France would not want to support military action on Iraq because it has a large Muslim population and is Iraq's largest trade partner.  Perhaps they don't want a conflict because they want Saddam's oil.

OK, I had to ramble on a bit.  Nobody, I mean, nobody otta take my word for it.  I just felt I had an obligation to shout it from the rooftops for a little while.  If you want more information bust out Google and find some non-mass-media skewed info.

This was not about a war on Iraq, but rather about people's views of my country.

<hr width='50%' size=1>

Onto the real issues.

I slept in more this morning, guess I am adjusting pretty well.  Not that I wasn't read to jump out of bed at 7 when I first work up, but my wife was home and she was being all hard to pry out of bed.  We didn't drag our selves out until a good 8:10.   Perhaps it will make it easier to stay up and go to Gymnastics tonight.

I am a little nervious about going to the gym, because I will try to do a roundoff-backhandspring-backtuck ' which I haven't done in over a month.  Not that I have ever had any issues with it, but I get a little nervous about it.   Last thing I wanna do is injure my self before my audition.

Wushu last night was good.  When I first got there LXL was asking me about the people in China that were talking about 'that school that has all the people on the US team and the coach is a judge'.  She was trying to tell me that she wasn't so bad ' but I understood the situation better than she thought (I think).  I feel bad for her, she really is a good coach and tries really hard to stay out the political bitching that so many people get involved in.  It's all guilty by association type stuff.  I feel it goes both ways, and that association with the BJWT team redeems many of the former members.  Hmm, this may seem like I am attacking them for something ' which I am not.  I was just thinking that if LXL had that line on her resume many of the people here in the US would not be on her case.

I mostly think of this because I, personally, will never make the Beijing Team.  So if I want to coach I will have that working against me.  I know that the Beijing team is not longer THE team in China, things have leveled out in the pro-wushu world ' but they definitely have the largest presence here in the US.  Makes it hard for a skinny white guy to compete in the coach market.

Of course the next best thing is Cirque!  I would rather work for them anyway.  I bet they don't have to sleep on planks of wood.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[In a fit of blind not paying enough attention to the world around me I forgot that I was going to go to gymnastics tonight.  So it looks like I am going to dinner with some friends.  I know Carlos really doesn't mind if I don't show (esp. tonight, since he would not get paid anything, and doesn't have to stay so late), but I feel obligated to him.  Also to me, for that matter.  I know I have plenty of time to drill the particular tumbling that I want to have down for cirque, but I still feel pressure.  But on the other side of the coin I told Greg and Paulanie (the latter I don't think will make it) that I would go to dinner with them.  If dinner is on I will also give Glenn and Sean (and whoever else) a call to drag them along to Lost Dog.  I know Kelly also really wants to go.

So I am stuck in the position that I really don't' like.  I feel obligated to do both, but that cannot happen.  My gymnastics time is seriously limited, and I need to be making every effort to get there and train. But many of these relationships with all these people are very high on my priority list.

I hate the nervous feeling I get when I think about this situation.  I need to simply decide what is going to happen and stick to it.  Of course I had decided what was gonna happen, then I forgot and scheduled something in the middle and now I got the feeling I didn't want.

No reason to fret over it. I can drill some tumbling at wushu after class and go to dinner with the friends (and wife!).   Of course this means I will not risk the back tuck at the end ' and I will just do a bunch of roundoff-backhandsprings.  But it is better than nothing.  I'll have to throw in a few b-twists for good luck.

Now that I have vented, perhaps I can get some work done.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Well it turns out that I didn't make it to dinner, but went to gymnastics.  Funny thing is I had planned on going to dinner with the wushu peoples, but Kelly talked me out of it.  She called as I was on my way to wushu and pointed out that I was supposed to go flip.  I tried to come up with a rather lame sounding excuse for skipping gym and going to eat.  But it didn't work too well.  If my wife is telling me to go then I better go.  Normally she is doing everything to get my time to herself.  Of course she did come along and watch (flipping is so much better if you have an audience, especially if that audience is your wife).  It was really good.  After getting one or two spots on my little combo I was able to pull it off on my own just fine.  Carlos did stand there a few times to make sure I was OK, but I was doing fine.

Carlos is a really cool guy.  He had asked if I could pick up a sword for him in china, but I was really strapped for space and I knew he would understand if I didn't bring him back one.  So I didn't.  Instead we gave him some chocolate that Kelly got in Vienna.  But after talking to him, and having him stay around late in order to help me out (free of charge) I really wish I had gotten one for him. Of course Kelly did offer to give him the one I gave her ' but I want her to have it.  Plus it is a little too small for him. I may clean up the one I got from Ted and give it to Carlos.  It's a nice sword and only 'slightly' used.

I mentioned that I always seemed nervous when I try that roundoff-backhandspring'backtuck pass. Carlos said it was OK, that the adrenaline will make sure that I really get up.  I don't know how much it will really keep me pushing hard and getting higher or if it will just cause me to rush.

I always hate my self for not going for it. Of course this stance of slowly building up and waiting until I am more than ready to nail the trick before actually going for it has kept me injury free (from acute crash related injuries). It is very rare that I won't land what I am trying to.  But as a trade off it takes me a long time to get to that point.  I really need the push to help me progress.

This is where someone like Carlos is so vital.  First he is the only coach I have ever blindly trusted to spot me ' that helps.  Plus he will tell me to go and do something such as this r-b-b pass and I will do it. Because he would not be telling me to try if I was not going to make it.  There are times I will be thinking as I am running and mid round off that I shouldn't go for it.  This pass will not be good.  I have to resist these urges to bail on the trick.  I will have some of the strangest internal monologues while I am training.  In wushu I always try to think either of recent corrections to make sure I make the changes. 'Chop, circle, BOTH ARMS IN, and thrust ' back hand lower.'  Of course I also will hit those times when I will actually think out loud (in my head) 'what's the next move??!?'  If I get to that point I don't normally figure out the next move.

Gymnastics and other acrobatic tricks are totally different.  When I am trying something into the pit or other mats I will either be trying to figure out how to do it or just keep trying with no thought.  Once I make the transition to the actual floor -- place that I consider much more dangerous -- I will go through all sorts of monologue.  Sometimes I will pray.  Sometimes I will repeat a key correction in my head.  'Go back, and arms UP!' Sometimes I will second-guess my self.
When it gets to that point I find having other people around to train with very useful.  If I have a training buddy or a coach there telling me what I did or encouraging me to push and improve a lot of the negative thought simply don't have a chance to occur.

On a side note, my hammies are a little sore. Like slightly strained, near the top of the muscle.  I didn't have any trouble in China during the hardcore training, so I am thinking that it might be my training methods here at home.  In particular the warm-up. I need to stretch more in the morning, get back onto the rhythm ' and to actually warm up more before wushu.  Weather that be running laps around the room or whatever.  We did lots of inside laps running in Beijing, it was pretty serious and would slowly build up from a jog to a good sprint.  In the middle we would spend a lot of time at a quick jog doing weird skipping and jumping drills, everything from badminton to basketball to TKD stuff.  At first I thought it was pretty silly, but now I am crediting it to my well-being.  Plus it was fun.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[The 'Hello, HELLO!' people.

One of the most entertaining parts of Beijing were the 'Hello, HELLO!' people.  If you happen to wander around a popular sightseeing area in Beijing you probably have stumbled across these folks.  (On a nice side note, most of these people are a couple of young girls or a guy ' never anyone that would intimidate you, much less drag you into an ally and mug you.) The place where their presence cannot go unnoticed is Wang Fu Jin Business District.

You will be walking along, admiring the Scorpions on a stick that those crazy Japanese tourists are eating, and hear a faint 'Hello' ' Which will grow stronger and louder as it tracks you down.  Sometimes the 'Hello' will be a more inventive 'Where are you from' or 'are you American'.  If you make the mistake of replying in a nice manner you will invariably get a polite sob story about how artists in china are rejected by their peers and forced to beg on the street ' while they drag you off to a studio and try to sell you some stuff.  Sad thing is this sob story is for the most part true.  However, if you ignore them and walk by, many of them will get adamant and start screaming 'HELLO!' at you.  Well, this is neither fun nor entertaining (at least after the first few times), so I decided I needed new ways to deal with the situation.

The first way I discovered to deal with them was to say 'Wo bu shuo ying wen'.  Which doesn't work all that well.

Next attempt was to try talking in Spanish.  This was a much more successful.  The girl responded in Italian.  I said 'no intendo', she spoke in German. I told her 'you quiro juagar a la plya con las chicas' and she walked away. Much more fun.

I also tried talking really fast in English.  Didn't work quite as well.  If you continue to talk really fast ' even interrupt them whenever they try to get something in edge wise they will stay put and try to get you to follow them. So eventually I just kept talking and walked away.  They of course followed for a little while until a more cooperative person happened along.

I also tried to play tag with them.  The moment I heard them say hello, I would run after them tag them on the shoulder, declare 'your it!' and run off.  They didn't get it.

The final game I came up with is 'freeze hello'.  When someone address you with a 'hello' or 'where are you from' ' you freeze right there mid stride.  Don't move no matter what they say until they touch you.  At which point it's up to you -- you can yell at them not to touch you or run away or fall down on the street and try to swallow you tongue.

I am sure there are many more fun things to try.  One of the better ones would be to try and sell them something.  Or maybe see how far you can get them to follow you. But please, don't just ignore them.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Never made it to the tournament this weekend.  Gerald came up for the tournament (and actually he went, but didn't pay to go in, just hung out in the lobby), but I had little motivation to actually go.  It would have cost me $40 to get in and walk around to say hi to everyone.  After talking to Duanne, I feel I really should have competed ' there were only 3 wushu peeps there.  The only one that I have even heard of is John Su.  No Qiu Dong Xing or NASKA Alex to foil my plans.  Unfortunately the only forms I practice are compulsories; I really want to have a good individual form worked out.  After team trials I plan on switching and coming up with some individual forms ' don't know if I will try to work that in before or after learning spear.  Prolly after, I really want to learn spear now.  Them boys in China (esp. Sun Nio and Liu Yang) have inspired me to take up that pointy weapon.

My family all came up on Sunday to visit us.  They brought the entire clan: Nikki, Laura and Matt and Jacob, and of course my parents.  Jacob was a little shy at first, but he warmed up fast and demanded lots of my attention.  It was really great.  Ya know, they let him watch my DVD and he will jump around and kick in the air, then fall on the ground and roll around in imitation of me in my movies.  The fact that this little 2.5-year-old boy loves the movies so much makes all the work and effort worth it.  Laura and Matt will bribe Jacob with 'Chris Pants' or 'Chris Food' when Jacob is rejecting everything with a sound 'No!' ' I am the bribe for him.  That is so cool.

Apparently when ever they see an old Mercedes Jacob will announce that it is a 'Chris Car' ' Dmitry would be proud.

They all showed up around noon, Kelly made a spectacularly successful lunch: Celestial Salad, Grilled Tilapia (I actually did the grilling, yay me!) and Cuscus.  She threw in a birthday cake (or as Jacob calls is Happybirthdaycake!) for my father.

I had Chinese school at 4 (well, class started at 2, but I didn't go learn, just teach), so my parents took off then.  My kids were really good -- it was strange.  Lawrence was there and he really helps class run smoothly.  IF you tell him to go practice something he actually will go practice it.  He and May are nearly done with the form. I would like to get them to learn sword next ' mostly because long weapon is not going to happen.  Something to do with the fact that our practice space is a hallway in a local high school ' ceilings are low enough for me to jump up and touch.

I don't think I will require my kids to learn a weapon (there seems to be some uncertainty about weather their parents will allow that or not), but I am going to encourage them to.  May would be a good sword person.  Lawrence, the only other person close to finishing the beginner form, would be good with b'sword.   Now lets see if I can keep them around long enough for that to happen.  It's awkward to teach in the situation that I do, being part of the Chinese school I have little control over how things are run administratively (ie, training space) but full control over my class.  And I still need to decide for sure if I am gonna teach it next year.  I want to (good experience), but I also want my weekends back.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[What a crappy, crappy morning.  The first and worst thing was Kelly getting up at a nasty hour to leave me for the next two days.  Stupid Richmond.  But that was expected and planed for, what wasn't planned for was the fact that we would not be able to get the computer to start.  Mail has locked up and would not quit, so when Kelly wanted to shut down the entire computer it was waiting for mail.  She didn't know how to 'force quit' so she eventually just took the power away from the misbehaving Mac.  Well, now when we try to start her up she dose nothing at all.  Plugged in nice and neat.  Power bar is plugged in and turned on ' but nothing.  I press the power button and not a singe thing happens.  This happened when we first got it.  Kelly set up the computer before I got home, but when I got home and went to set her up, I would push the power button with no result.  Just sits there.  Magically it fixed it self last time.  I wiggled the power cord and turn the computer over and wiggled it.  No luck, so I am gonna take her in and get it serviced while I am still under AppleCare (which, I paid $350 for, mind you).   To top it off it was snowing for my morning commute.  Last thing we need is more snow.  At least they say it should stop by noon.  But 'they' didn't know the snow was coming at all.

Last night wasn't all that fun either.  Not that it was bad, just not very pleasant.  Kelly was bogged down at work and didn't get home until 8:45 or so.  I changed the fender flare on the Jeep in the dark.  I got all but two of the screws in before the cold cause so much pain that my fingers would not function.  I was going to finish this morning, but not in the snow ' it's on plenty good.

Kelly and I had plans to go out last night and blow my massively disappointing bonus check on a nice dinner, but we would have been out late and both of us were tired.  So we got some Chinese take out and watched 'The Fire Within.'

Neither of us worked out.  And we were both in bed by 11, which is a good thing.  But I was grumpy and Kelly wanted my attention ' which I provided in very harsh and brash spurts.  And she was the one that worked 12 hours that day.  Damn, I was being a jerk.

She has a big important presentation to a high-up person at work today; in fact she is probably giving that as I type.  Hopefully she does well, and doesn't worry about breaking my computer (which is not her fault to begin with).

Well, I will see how early I can get out of here today, the Mac is all packed up in it's box, I will try to run by the Apple store before wushu.  And tonight I got wushu and gymnastics, so that should make for a good time.  Of course I come home to an empty house, that lack of wife is no fun.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Thought the morning was crappy?  It aint nothing.  I got called into my boss's office around 4:30 for a littile "We aint got no money" meeting.  fun stuff.  i basically got laid off.  Right now I have a few weeks of full time then we are going to part time until the cash runs out.  I just burned all my vacaion (and a decent amount of savings) on my trip, so I only got a few more days of that left.  Well I called my pimp (aka Kelly Daddy, who got me the job) to see if he can send any work this-a-way.  I feel like that "good for nothing" son-in-law that needs the hand outs from Daddy in order to support his daughter.

Well, I guess things could be worse.  Oh wait, I am late for wushu (which is paid for this month) and a telemarketer just called -- so it is a little worse.  Did I mention that I got an email from Cirque?  it suks too -- it said they were postponing the audition for NYC for an indefinate amount of time.  I really hope I get the chance to acutally audition.  If I get the cirque gig all this headache will be forgotten in the blink of an eye.  Poof all better....I can dream.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Well today hasn't been all that fun.  I spent most of the morning updating my resume.  It is a good solid page and a half, I don't' know how I can trim it down to one page and keep the necessary information on it.  There are some topics that I feel are really important on their own, but can be combined into one or two sentences.  I hate that, I feel like I am underselling my self by being too brief.  I sent it to Kelly to get some corrections done, but she was pretty busy at work and couldn't pour the time it needed into it.  I will get my father-in-law to look at it, he is really good at that stuff ' but I am annoyed that I HAVE to go to him for help with stuff that I really should be able to do my self.

At least I had Wushu and Gymnastics to keep me occupied for a while last night.  I was pretty grumpy at wushu.  One of the younger kids, Donavan, was playing around and kept tagging me and telling me I was 'it', and I wound up snapping at him.  Then I wanted to explain why I was being bitchy, but didn't want to get stuck talking about this situation with everyone there.

I convinced quite a few people to come along to gymnastics.  We had Emily, Sarah, Vivi, and myself coming straight from Wushu to go flip.  It was fun, we worked on Arial Twists and Tornado splits and B-Twists.  Bryan has a sweet Arial Twist ' which is strange because he doesn't have an Arial.   I also worked on my roundoff-backhandspring-backtuck for a while, I even did one where my hands didn't touch on the back handspring and I still went for the back tuck.  I guess that makes it a round off whip-back back tuck.  Which sounds cooler, but was scary at the time.  Carlos spotted me for the first one, and then when he wasn't watching I did another.  He came back and asked if I was ready for another ' which I got to respond with 'I already did one'.  I was so happy, normally I would be begging him for more help, but now I was doing it just fine on my own.

We went to the Afghan restaurant for lunch, spent some time talking about the current state of the company.  You would think with an impending lay-off I would not go out to eat.  Well there wasn't much at home for making food, so ate breakfast and brought in half a protein bar.  I figured that would last me till 4 or 5.  By 10:30 I already ate the power bar.  At least for my $6 at the Afghan Buffet I over ate and stuffed my self with rice and chicken and other good tasting good for you foods.

Time to browse the want ads.  Or maybe look up information on teaching English in China.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Yesterday was a much better day than the day before.  I talked to Kim and it looks like I am full time at least until the end of the month.  We have also gotten some positive feed back from a few people.  Nothing solid like an interview, but this job hunt is looking better than the last time through.  Maybe having a few weeks of full time work helps.  Who knows, maybe I can simply stay here and we can find work for me at DCS.

Wushu was pretty good last night, we never got to forms -- just did a bunch of basics.  We worked on butterflies for a long time.  It may be an ego thing, but I honestly feel like I have a really good butterfly.  A lot of my wushu really sucks, but even in Beijing I was (from my perception of the situation) right in there with the best as far as butterflies go.  Start adding twists and the entire story changes, however, coach sort of seemed like she was trying to come up with stuff that I needed to change simply because everyone had to work on butterflies at the time.  I could be totally off base and really need to fix a few things.  I know my arms prolly need to be situated better mid-butterfly, but she wanted our legs way high.  Perhaps it is really just a way of overemphasizing in order to get people to be at least level and get that arch look that everyone loves.

I bought a staff last night, coach wanted to know why I didn't buy one in china.  I tried to explain that I thought I had.  In fact I bought 3.  and planned on using at least 1 of those for a spear -- but they are all way to thick and long.  I know I can cut it to make it shorter, and shave it down to make it thinner -- I just like that waxwood finish.  A little knobby, a little irregular, and that bark to keep it from drying out too fast.  I also picked up some of that Red Hair stuff for the end of my spear -- even went to home depot to try and find some metal balls for inside the spear with no luck.  I will go to Sports Authority today and see if they have slingshot shot.

For some reason I have been thinking about the history of wushu these past few days.  Then someone mentions the raffi's message board about how Taiji came from the Wudan mountain.  That comment was quickly followed up by a message saying that the Wudan mountain thing was debunked by Chinese historians.  I know how off base the Shaolin Temple thing is, Jet Li himself debunked that, but so many people buy into that story. I mean it is the same thing with Tae Kwon Do (or Tang Soo Do or what have you), they have these big romantic histories that really aren't based on anything.  Maybe some old paintings of people practicing martial arts, but there are no solid ties between that stuff an dthe modern day Korean arts.  There are, however, very solid ties between Karate and the Japanese occupation to the modern day Korean martial arts.  In fact if you look at it the arts are basically the same, they have just been split for 50 years and most of the differences are simply due to evolving along separate paths.  I remember when Gerald and I were researching this TKD history thing, we found out all sorts of strange things -- stuff that many well intentioned TKD instructors would deny -- but from a historical point of view were very true.

I know contemporary wushu vase pretty much invented by communist government mandate, but that does not deter me.  Just because the communists are to blame does not make it evil. I know they gathered a large number of 'masters' and forced them to modernize and standardize the martial arts into this acrobatic gyration I call Wushu.  What I don't know is what masters were gathered and where they came from.  I wonder if this information is easily obtainable.  I guess I can go ask Google and see.  But I am guessing if it is obtainable it is only available in paper and ink form, and that form probably consists of Chinese and not English.

More research is needed, fo sho.

Someone just walked by my cube, and spread a very strong poopie smell.  Ugh.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Brandon has shown up, he came up this weekend with some girl and is going to be hanging around for the next few days.  I think he may want to take her around and do the D.C. thing, so Kelly and I may tag along for that.  I didn't get in until pretty late, I had time to go to wushu and gymnastics and still get home before he showed up (or Kelly came back form hanging out with Jeannie).

Wushu was good last night, the first time I had done staff in over a month.  My staff form was a little sorry ' and for some reason I was elected to go first for each section.  Which really sucked ' if I could have seen the section at least once before I went I would have been in good shape.  But I was trying to remember where the section started, where it ended and what to do. After the first run through I was in decent shape, but not where I want to be.  I think my staff form could be much better.  Watching the good people do it really inspired me to add more Blamo and Pow to my form.  I am fairly sure it won't take too long to take it up a few notches.

Gymnastics was cool, very short.  I just tumbled for 15 or 20 minutes and then went to go practice climbing the rope.  I was a wuss and used my feet on the way down.  Then on the second try I used my feet about halfway up (not to push, but to allow my self to rest) ' one good thing about the audition getting pushed back is more time to train.  At this rate I should have a layout out of by back handspring (I sorta have one now with just the round off).  Now if I can only keep my feet together. And get my arms up. And travel forward more on my hurdle.

I have to think way too much when I tumble, I need to do it 100 times to get comfortable with it.

I otta go call Brandon and get him to come out early for lunch so I can make it back to an after noon meeting.  Unfortunately the meeting is about the ramifications of going part time.  Stupid work not giving me work.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[The [Peking Duck Message Board]( http://fuzzymonk.homeip.net:8080/pdbb/ ) is all but dead.  I go to China for less than a month and it all falls apart.  Stupid Communist government, why did they have to block my web page?

Well I just got out of a meeting on all the crappy things that will happen to me once I go part time here.  If they can't keep me above 30 hours a week life will suck.  On the plus side they had this meeting at lunch time so we get all afternoon to not wanna do anything at all.  Ugh, cranking out code is so much harder when you think 1) it's never gonna be used 2) you are not gonna be around to finish it anyway.

I will just keep telling my self that if I work hard now that when the company gets more work they will like me more and give it to me.

Hey! Stop laughing at me.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[This weekend was pretty interesting.  Brandon brought up this girl Jen, who had never been to D.C. before.  So, we decide we will take her in to town and do the Smithsonian and all that ' plus Nikki had come up and we could drag her along to that.  Well it turns out that there was a Protest against the war with Iraq.  The metro was packed and took a crazy long time to get us in to town (single tracking on the orange line).  Once we were there we wandered aimlessly and made fun of a few of the protest signs.  I especially like the big sign that said 'SUV WAR.'  We wandered down to Jefferson and then back by the Holocaust Museum.  We did go through security at the Holocaust but didn't make it inside to actually see anything.  So we grabbed some lunch and Kelly, Nikki and I took off leaving Brandon and Jen to find their own way back.

Kelly and I headed to Beej and Katie's wedding ' Which was a crazy fun blast from the past.  We got to see JC (and Ronnie) and Krouse.  Fun little reunion of a few of the freshman hall gang.  Surprisingly, the open bar led to Krouse getting a little plastered and JC had to take him home.  I too enjoyed the open bar, but I had Kelly to watch after me.

Sunday was not as exciting, Church then met up with Brandon, Jen and Jeff Labreque (of VTTKD fame) for lunch.  I took off early to make it to Chinese class.  But there was no Chinese class.  There was Chinese school, but I went to the room where my class is ' it was full of little kids, which is not normal.  Eventually the Principal found me and she asked around ' yep, my teacher and classmates were not there.  So drove down the street and got a cup of coffee then drove by Peter's place to see if he was maybe walking out at that same time and the sight of me driving up would have suddenly made him want to hang out with me and we would be all happy and cool.  But instead I watched the SCA battle in homemade armor.  Went back and taught me some wushu.  The kids were pretty good.  The two oldest girls are kinda getting a little too comfortable and will goof off too much, so I am prolly going to have to smack them back into place with some horse stance practice next time they act up ' they were the best behaved kids, but I gave them a little too much freedom and they are abusing it now.  But that can be fixed!  Oh, I have to remember to ask Sean to see if he can cover me next week because I may not make it in time for the beginning of class.  My flight back form Texas gets in at 3, and class starts at 4 so it is gonna be tight.

I need to make a portfolio ' but have little motivation to do so.  I mean, I want a nice job in Graphics Design, but I will prolly get a programming job much easier and with higher pay'but design is more fun'so I should make that portfolio.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Normally I take Monday nights off from wushu, I use it as time to hang out with the wife and enjoy her company.  Plus we normally make some dinner and watch 'The Fire Within' on Bravo.  But, because I am headed out of the state at the end of the week then I will go ahead and get my classes while I can.  I will not be able to make class on Thursday Friday or Saturday.  And hopefully I will make it back in time for my Chinese school class (you know, that I teach and all).  Actually I called Sean and asked him to cover for me.  I really feel bad about that ' I asked him to cover for me while I was in China and he made it clear that he was not comfortable doing that.  So I just canceled class for 2 weeks and had Kelly cover the last class.  I feel like I pressured him into covering my ass, and that I really should consider bugging some other people to help me out on this.   But I am torn by whom I should ask and Sean presents the wonderful state of being unassociated with any of the local political wushu factions.  I'll simply have to make it up to him.

The work situation seems better than last time I was laid off, first of all I didn't get cut right away ' they are giving me warning about this ' and they insist that there is a chance that I could get some more work here.  I am not too hopeful about that, and it seems that a lot of my good leads to other companies would be through people here that could pass my resume on.  Which is good to have, but the people here don't' want to help me out until they know that I will not have funding here for sure.  So they make me wait.

It really sucks that Cirque said they don't know when my audition is going to be, it would have been good timing if I could have auditioned in a few weeks and been able to hear something back relatively soon after that.  I know Cirque has this wonderful way of doing what ever they want (they do have all the power here), but if I could plan one way or the other it would make my life much simpler.   I do know they wanted to start training for the show this spring, but spring is upon us so I am getting a little worried about it.  At least I know Morgan auditioned in December, and passed, but is being called back for the April one too.  It makes me feel better that he showed up early and they still want him to come back, you know, like I didn't miss my chance at my dream job.  I have never known a time when I saw a clear path to exactly what I want to do ' what ever life style changes it requires are worth it for that gig.  (Thank God for Kelly and her support of that)

Well work wants me to do work; even though they said they are going to stop asking soon.  Kind of kills my motivation, but I will at least go through the motions for a while.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I found out last night that the Discovery Channel is going to be coming to O-Mei to do some filming of wushu and get interviews from the coach and some athletes.   Apparently it is a special that has to do with the possibility of wushu becoming and Olympic sport.  How cool is that ' I always loved those specials on Martial Arts ' and now they are coming to my school. Oh, did I mention that I am going to this Friday, so Kelly can finish up her dental work ' yeah the discovery channel is coming this Friday.  Poopie!  Stupid timing.

Well, I will just have to wait until I have my own school and the discovery channel wants to film at it.  Yeah, that'll be much cooler.  (I know, I am a media ho)

Wushu and Gymnastics had an off feeling last night.  Wushu was just a really small class, and I was struggling with sword.  Stuff that I had mastered only a few weeks ago I was bumbling like crazy tonight.  I have this strange love hate relationship with my new sword.  I really don't like it ' except when it is making nice loud sounds, which it does all the time.  I can get it to snap on anything and every thing ' so easy.  But it's balance is all off making it awkward on the flowers and figure eights.  But the worst part of it is the hand guard ' the part a the top of the hilt where the blade comes out is shaped sorta like a 'Y' and on my guiding jian it is more like a 'T'.  This sucks because it will grab my index finger ' which slides down right next to the blade.  This causes figure eights and the like to be dangerous to my finger's well being.  I either need to fill in the gaps to make my Y into a T (and add weight to the pommel to balance it) or swap the entire hilt with from a guiding sword.  Perhaps I will use my old lion head one (which I don't really like, but is better than what I got) or borrow Kelly's hilt from the Guiding sword I gave her until after team trials.  At which point I can switch back to my sword and be happy.  Happy and quite.  Because I can't make that blade snap for anything.

Gymnastics was pretty good.  I wasn't punching out of my back handsprings very well.  I still land with my feet apart and knees bent.  But I will get it.  Kyle actually showed up on time, but he left early. Bryan tried to break cinder blocks with his index finger (and broke 1 of the 3 with it) so his hand was all swollen up and he wasn't in the mood for flipping.  Carlos did point out that back tucks and aerials didn't require hands, but that didn't persuade him.

I wound up leaving early so I could go talk to Kelly before she went to bed.  I wound up getting home 'round 10:20 or so and called her hotel ' she was still doing work.  Her and her work.  I can't complain though ' she can keep a job for more than a year.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[My elbows hurt last night at wushu something nasty.  Don't have a clue why.  I know I tweaked my shoulder during warms ups and it was a little throbbie during class, and I got that hip thing going on still, but my elbows. Like on the inside, just above that boney knob where you triceps inserts. I couldn't tell if it was muscle or joint or tendon or what. Weird strong dull pain.  It went away after about an hour or two of resting after class, but was very strong by the end of class.

I am still annoyed that the Discovery channel is coming on a day I cannot be there.

We did get to have dinner with Jeannie and her Brother and even Sean.  It was pretty nice, even though I went AWOL for about 2 hours in the middle there.  When I got home they were watching Hero and we discovered how to get the English subtitles on.  Happy day!  English subbed hero!  Jet Li uber fun! (or should I say fei-chang fei-chang fun?).  Now I got to go rewatch it.  I still haven't seen it all the way through.

After dinner (and after showing pictures from our trips) I talked Jeannie and Danny into staying for a quick game of 'Big Idea' ' a Cheapass game.  Pretty fun stuff.  You get to invent products and play the stock market to try to sell them.  My Addictive Pants were a hit.  Despite high investor interest Mexi-Cat failed.  I still haven't played a game of Go in months, and I am inching to do so ' but a cheapass game is about the next best thing.  I am trying to stay away from the PS2 ' but that GTA:VC is so much fun.  Bad, Evil, and Not Very Nice -- but fun.

Headed to Texas this afternoon, I get back at 3pm on Sunday.  I teach wushu at 4.  This is going to be tight.  (BTW, Thanks Sean)]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Got back from Texas yesterday.  Our plane was on time, so we landed right about 3 ' and I actually made it home to change clothes and unload our bags then run off to my 5 o'clock wushu class at Chinese school.  The kids were pretty good, the only problem is the oldest girl is getting a little over confident of her self in that class ' she things she has the run of the place and that the rules don't apply to her.  *sigh* I guess I am gonna just have to smack her back into place.  I did send her off to do horse stance yesterday, but that didn't seem to change much.  I don't really get mad at them, but I think I may need to make them think I have gotten mad to provoke the response I want.   I guess I am still verdant enough that I think they will figure this wushu thing out and behave on their own.  I'd be nice if I could actually get some older kids, but if we were gonna do that we would need a second class ' It's not fair to cram them in with 7-8 year old kids that cannot line up with out being yelled at.

Texas we fun, my Nana was looking very good despite all the crazy surgery she has partaken of since I have seen her.  Which has been over 3 years, before I got married.  We hung out with my half of the family Saturday afternoon and stayed with them Saturday night.  Kelly's half was Thursday night/Friday.  It really wasn't bad going around and seeing all her family, I have at least met them all in the past, which makes this much nicer.  Both of Kelly's grandparents seem to be doing well.

After wushu class sean came over and we went to Lost Dog.  Great place.  It's a little sandwich and pizza type place, crazy paintings of dogs on the walls and an eclectic menu of oddly named sandwiches.  I got my usual Irish Gyro ' feta, lettuce, and beef on a pita. Mmmm.

Job search update:  I got two calls on my answering machine when we got back on Sunday ' one from lock-mart and the other from Spherion.  I will let you know if I get an interview after a call them this morning.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Checked up on those companies -- Spherion Corporation is just a headhunter.  So I hadn't called them yet.  I do plan on putting a call into them today, as well as Wallach ' so I will be full out headhunted.  Oh, the good news is I got an interview with Lockheed ' up until now I have never been turned down once I get the interview  *knocks on wood*, so this could be a good thing.  We will see how this whole thing fits into the long term plan ' things are getting tricky these days.

It seems that my current company is sliding down the hill and a number of people are gonna be leaving here weather they want to or not.  Even my boss is saying he is going to go get headhunted.

It's funny how this about-to-have-no-job state of being changes my view of life and career.  When I enter into this situation everything shifts into immediate urgent mode, and I have to go and find a quick fix on a way to secure income.  Of course I would like to step back and figure out how to improve my life and review my career path so that I am headed in a direction that I want, but that is not priority.  Of course anyone that knows me knows my current career plan involves at least another 5 years of supporting my wushu habits and saving money.  But all of that is subject to change, the last thing I want to do is commit my self to a certain plan.  Situations shift around, if I happen upon a new job that for some reason I love (despite sitting in a cube under florescent lights) ' it might just happen to be the perfect way to commence the baby producing state of marriage.

Or maybe it is time for us to move to China and learn proper Chinese/Wushu there.  At least that would make a great story.  Of course that is not the situation that I am interested in having a family.  A wife yes, but no xiao hai zi.

Yesterday I washed and waxed the jeep, looks nice now.  However I did find a nasty scrape on the bottom of the passenger side door where someone decided to open their door into the jeep.  Teddy is up-to-date on just about everything -- oil, maintenance ' only thing that is about ready to happen is the inspection in 2 months.

I skipped wushu to hang out with Kelly and get the jeep nice and clean.  I haven't been since Wednesday ' I wanted to rest for w while because of how bad my elbows and hip were hurting.  Of course I have not tested my limbs to see if they are better or if they are simply not hurting because I have refrained from exerting them.  We will see tonight.  Sword class, that's how I hurt my hip to begin with.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Finally, I was able to easily pull off a round off-back hand spring-back tuck with no spotter at all.  And it was better than last week -- much cleaner.  Or at least it felt much cleaner.

Boss man, BRB.

Yep.  It has happened.  I am officially let go.  I am full-time through the 31st and will be part-time through the 15th.   Getting laid off sucks, I think it is worse because I knew it was coming.  Gonna be spending a lot of time down on the CD-R computer saving all my files.

On the plus side one of my co-workers (okay, former co-worker), mark, has an in for me getting into the Circus.  Kick Boxing Orangutan.  But not just anywhere, in a giant steel sphere with motorcycles driving around us.  If that doesn't work we will set the entire thing on fire.

It's a sure fire solution.  Either that or I am going to more to china and each English.  Anyone know a weekend course in ESOL?  Maybe I will go get my trainer cert and work at a gym.  Prolly settle into another high stress computer job.  Ugh.

Sword class was pretty good.  I just hate that lightweight cheap sword that coach wants me to use.  I much prefer my guiding one.  If it only made sound.  I think I may take the blade off my guiding sword and swap it with my lightweight one and see how that works.  Perhaps that balance will be fixed and I won't have to smelt any lead.  Plus we all know how crappy the finger guard is on the lightweight swords.  In fact I don't think they should call it a finger guard -- more like a finger hurt.  Because that is what it does.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Sounds like I have a pretty sure fire thing at DCS.  So I could stay with my current job.  HOWEVER, it would be in PAX River.  Pax is prolly a good 30 minutes south of Waldorf.  Waldorf is a good hour from where we live with moderate traffic.  On the plus side I would be going against traffic the entire way -- or Kelly and I could even live out there and buy a house with my salary alone.  But then the wushu thing comes into play -- that is my serious long-term goal.  I *could* drive out to Fairfax 3 times a week, but that is far from the idea.  And I have the ideal wushu situation right now -- I can leave 10 minutes before class starts and still have time to warm up a little.  There are a few big +'s to Pax and the 'dorf  -- the only down sides are Wushu, Kelly's Job (which she wouldn't really need), if I get the Cirque gig, and Wushu.

I do have my interviews with Lockheed and Booz, so I really don't have any clue on those positions.  Next week I will have a better feel for them.

Skipped wushu last night, it was a long crappy day -- and to celebrate my official lay-off notification we went to the mall and bought two dress shirts at JC Penny's for real cheap and picked up some fake pearls for Elizabeth's wedding.   I'll go to wushu AND gymnastics tonight and that should help me feel better.

Off to watch more [Odd Todd](http://www.oddtodd.com/)]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I have an interview with Pearl Software here in about 30 minutes.  Just a phone interview, but it still counts as an interview.  Pretty interesting, it looks like a small company.  I don't know how many people they have, but the fact that I have exchanged emails with the CEO and founder and my interview is with the CTO and other founder makes me think it is not a lumbering large corporation.  Looks like it would be a good gig -- they do Internet content filtering and monitoring and I would have to interact with law enforcement...plus they have this foundation that is on the mission of educating parents about protecting their kids online.  Beats the hell out of 24/7 (they owned IMAKE) -- they would spam people for money. The big issue is not doing the work or the size of the company -- it looks like I would be taking a 10 grand pay cut for this position.  No fun at all.  I will see if it is negotiable or there will be ample opportunity for advancement.  Other than pay this place looks nice.

Skipped wushu because my elbow was killing me.  'How did I hurt it?', you may ask -- well a combination of Corporal Tunnel Syndrome and climbing a rope with my legs out straight in front of me.  I tried to ice my arm and my hand got all cold and numb.  I think it has to do with the angle your hand grips the rope and the stresses that puts on the nerve.  This opinion is a direct result from when I had ouchie elbow pain when turning on my blinker on the drive home yesterday.  You will notice when you put your blinker on you hand is in close to the same position that it is when you climb a rope.  Needless to say I didn't climb a rope at gymnastics last night.  But I did go to gymnastics -- and I successfully tumbled and it didn't cause any pain.  I think wushu would have hurt -- staff class and all.  Lots of elbow stress and funny hand-gripping positions.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[On raffi's message board Matt Stampe said:
<blockquote>LINEAGE, INTEGRITY and HONESTY in Wushu

Currently in America, anyone can virtually start a wushu school, and the consumer wouldnt know the difference unless they are well educated and well informed on the instructors' lineage and level of education. In china the process is very difficult. Not anyone in a country of a billion can become a wushu team member or a instructor. It is run by a system that licenses and tests instructors and there knowledge and skills in demonstrations, theory and history. Here in America we can have a immigrating chinese master of high level with no wushu school struggling in the american life, while an american person with a few years can start a school with low level skill and questionable ability. The compulsory forms that are required for International wushu competition have few teachers and many people have to rely on videos and books. There are also not many wushu instructors to go around so it causes much problems as to how to get the 'right' details out to everyone. Because the 'New' compulsories are now out, virtually everyone who has learned them from a QUALIFIED instructor basically is now a instructor already. This causes a problem with passing bad habits, skipping levels, and losing vital points of intention. The final result is often sloppy, flavorless, stale, and ghastly looking forms. A true master knows how to break down a form from the inside out and make it alive, bold and powerful. That is kung fu. It is even more important to have a strong relationship with this type of master. So many times the teacher-student relationship is short lived. In actuality, kung fu only comes from the grace and blessings of your lineage teacher through trust and hard work that is part you and part your teacher. In time you see growth and progression because of the teachers scrutiny at catching mistakes, bad habits dissolve and you come closer to self-perfection. Wushu is the same as, "off by one inch, gone by a mile."

i welcome feedback!

</blockquote>

And I replied with:
<blockquote>Matt,

Actually I find your commentary very interesting.  Personally it is vary valid as I hope to one day become a coach and that is the career that I am actively working towards.  But I would change the word order around in your title.  I think Integrity and honesty are pretty much one in the same in the context you use them -- and are critical for a coach.   Lack of honesty and integrity is a much more damaging blow that wushu related ignorance in a coach.  I see much more damage potential in a coach that has great talent in wushu, and teaching wushu, than in a coach that has integrity but teaches bad wushu.

Lineage.  I don't place so much importance on this -- a few years ago I would have never considered studying under anyone unless they could drop the right names.  Coaches had to be former something-important-sounding in order for me to consider them as valid.  Now I am not so sure -- while often people who have good credentials turn out to be fine coaches it is not always that case.  People often say good athletes don?t necessarily make the best coaches.   This is trite, and rather one-dimensional statement in this situation, but the jist is pretty accurate.

I agree 100% that the blessing of studying wushu comes from hard work and determination of the student, and the insights of a good coach are priceless; but I think the best growth comes from personal insight and refinement.  Perhaps the good coaches promote that, but it is not something that can be corrected during a wushu class -- it requires more than who your teacher's teacher was.  People have to seriously think and carefully study, make their own refinements and improvements in order to progress.

Perhaps this linage thing might help the inept wushu coaches from starting up schools, but I think that is not the best way to judge knowledge and ability. I love the idea of more formal education or other certification for coaches (and judges for that matter), but we lack the infrastructure for providing that.  I seriously doubt that any country in the world could provide said training, except for china -- where they have the government's blessing, support and funding.

Now we need to start a non-profit organization for the education of martial arts students so they can learn if their coach is legit.  It's too easy for a person to drop names or claim a few lofty credentials; we need to judge them by their skills.  Not exactly easy to do ? but worth the effort it takes.
</blockquote>

Not the best or even a very well thought out response (shoulda and coulda done a better job writing what I feel), but I wanted to post it here for safe keeping.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Ok, Saturday it was nice and warm, I changed out of my Adidas basketball pants because I was too hot and put on some shorts.  When we work up Sunday it was snowing like crazy -- big huge flake were floating down everywhere.  It never stuck to the ground, but trees and grass were all white.  Then today it all was gone when I woke up.  Virginia is doing some strange weather these days.

Friday I just went to wushu, wound up staying there and talking to coach about all sorts of crazy stuff. I asked her how she originally came to the U.S. and she told us this great story.  Apparently she had talked to an U.S. diplomat back in china, he was gonna help her get her Visa.  When she went to go talk to him about getting a visa, he didn't believe that she was a Wushu person, so he asked for some tickets to a big Volleyball game that was going on at her school (BUPE) -- well she came through and hooked him up with the tickets, "so easy".  So he told her to come and see him in 3 months and he would help her out.  In the mean time she had gotten a temporary visa and come to the US, working as a waitress. Well one day near the end of the day the other waitress said she didn't want to wait on this last guy, said he looked cheap.  So Xiao Lin said she would.  He started asking some strange questions, but Xiao Lin was shy and didn't ever look at his face.  He was asking about the food here compared to china.  When he mentioned Sichuan she said that she was from Sichuan -- the blossomed into him talking in Chinese and allowed Xiao Lin to relax and be more talkative.  He kept asking if she knew him -- until he came out and told her that he has seen her compete in wushu in China.  At this point she remembers he had told her to come see him after 3 months.  Aiya! But he answered a lot of questions and told her what to do to bring Xiang Bo over as well.  It was a crazy story of very strange improbable occurrences -- and I am sure that I am getting all the details screwed up.  But it is fun anyway.

Saturday they had the photographer at O-Mei -- The fundraising thing for the floor.  I did 5 poses.  2 sword, 2 changquan and 1 broad sword.  I never did any pudao, even though I brought it in.  I never could think of a good pose for pudao that didn't look silly.  Of course after I was done Coach asked why I didn't do pudao, and proceeded to show me a number of crazy cool poses.  Well I am pretty happy with what I have.

Saturday evening we had a bunch of wushu peeps over.  Glenn drug Paulo over.  Sean and josh hung out for a while.  The entire reason we even got together was Laura was in town for spring break so Sarah wanted to have a little gathering before they all went clubbing.  She even outright asked to use my place.  Well Laura never showed, and we waited for Sarah to come so we could go get dinner for a few hours.  Eventually we got tired of waiting and put a note on the door and the 6 of us went to grab some food at the diner.  Paulo stole one of Glenn's hamburgers in a fit of fun and we kept making off color comments that were not intended to be off color.

Sunday, Sean rode his bike home in the snow and I went to Chinese school.  Todd and Marilee canceled on us because of the snow (they did spend 4 or 5 hours driving to our house from Richmond).]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I hope I just have allergies; I don't wanna deal with getting sick right now.  But it seems my body is telling me I have a cold.   I had my interview yesterday with Booz Allen Hamilton, it went well ' I would really like to get that job.  I couldn't tell from the interviewers how my shot at the position was -- I don't know if I am a favorite or not.  Non-the-less I am getting ancy to hear back from them and it has only been about 18 hours.

Wushu went pretty well last night; I didn't bring in my light-n-loud sword so I practiced with my guiding one instead.  I actually feel like I do a better form with that sword.  Plus I was getting it to snap all over the place.  No snap in the chop ' I could only get sound with a thrust.  It just seemed to flow better.  Coach didn't comment one way or the other, so I will try it for a few more classes and see what happens.  I tried to do my Pudao form after class and I couldn't remember much of it.  I have maybe 2 sections that I can do.  Coach Lu laughed when she saw me trying to remember the form and told me that after a week of not practicing you start to forget (ie you gotta stop and think) and after a month you will forget most of the form (this goes for new forms you are learning).  Well, it must have been a month.  I think I will concentrate on 9 section whip for the time being.

9 section just has more going for it.  For starters, it is small enough to carry around in my bag, while Pudao is beefy and attracts a lot of attention (not just attention while you do the routine, but jus carrying it around ' it gets old).  While more people are doing 9 section these days it is still a nice flashy weapon.  I have noticed that the more people do 9 section the more crappy 9 section forms I see -- not that there are not good routines out there, I just see more and more crappy ones.   Actually I was watching Rene's self-made form after class and thought it was pretty snazzy.  Not too many awkward looking moves.

Chris's First rule of 9 Section Whip:  Don't put in a skill just because you can do it, put it in because it looks good.

Of course there is a corollary that says if you can't do it don't.  There are way to many people that do some awkward strange tricks in their whip form.  Otherwise it would be a slick form, but they had to do something that made everyone think 'wow, that is funny looking'

All that said, I need to go work on my butt-jumping skills.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Ugh, I am home today -- I have a doctor's appointment at 11.  Sinus infection I think.  I have been coughing up all sorts of interesting things.  Yeah, I will spare you of the details.

Needless to say I skipped wushu last night.  Just didn't feel up to it.  ANd it looks like tonight I will not be going to Wushu or gymnastics.  Mostly that is because of my interview with Lockheed.  It is a bit annoying.  I originally scheduled it for 3 to 5, but I talked to Kim and he said I was gonna be full time this pay period.  So I called lockheed back and rescheduled for 5 to 7. Well, I have 42 hours for 2 weeks -- so i am more like half time.  So 3 to 5 would have been better.  In theory I could have still gone to Wushu -- but if i don't feel well it doesn't matter too much.  Still, I think I am headed out to Waldorf this evening, so I would have been out there earlier (but, that would require driving during rush hour).   I guess what i am trying to say is I am annoyed that I am sick AND unemployed.  In reality my schedule is good.  Plus I got a call form [AMS](http://www.ams.com) this morning -- that big consulting firm -- it would be cool to work with them.  Funny thing about that is the location would be across the street from my old apartment -- but even from my current apartment that would not be a bad drive.

I am gonna go drink hot tea and practice some [contact juggling](http://www.contractjugling.org).

For you mac people out there, <a href"http://hydra.globalse.org/">Hydra</a> rocks.  Good text editor, does everything I need -- but unlike BBEdit it is nice and free.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I am not working today.  I got me some harsh laryngitis ' not the best thing to have when you are at an interview.  I was a little raspy when I showed up at the Lockheed interview, and by the time I left I was sounding horrible.   Not the best impression.  At least I had my spiffy new suit.  Thank God, because that old wool one from high school would have made me sweat through my shirt.  Other than the voice thing, I think it went very well.

What do people have against American food?  Or rather why don't people know what American food is?  If you ask someone what is 'American' they are gonna say Hamburgers and French fries.  Not that these are not American foods ' they are ' but there are so may more food types that Americans eat.  I mentioned that when I was in china we asked Li Qiang if she liked American food and she said she would go crazy if she had to eat it every day.  I think she was saying that she would go crazy if she ate McDonalds every day.  But so would I, and American food is my favorite.  No one ever thinks of a roasted turkey dinner with sweet potatoes and fried apples.  Or a good chicken pot pie.  Steak Dinner with baked potato, Pork chops and apple sauce (Homer's Favorite), Waffles and eggs, Pancakes and Bacon ' you get the idea.  I don't know why I get offended when people dis American food.  Maybe I am being patriotic.  Maybe it's that ingrained human desire to try and convince everyone around you to like the same things you do.  Don't get me started when someone says 'oh, wushu, that's more like a dance than a martial art'.  That causes the same internal reaction that I get when people group all American food as fast food.  Stupid fast food.

Don't they know eating at McDonalds makes you a bad person.  Least that is what I tell my wife (and she tells me).]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[The wedding made that weekend long and anti-relaxing.  Kelly was the Matron of Honor and I was the videographer. So needless to say we were busy the entire time.  Anything that upset Elizabeth (a.k.a. the bride) Kelly would unleash her full effort to fixing.  She was very high strung and determined to fix everything herself.  To her credit, She did try to assign others jobs to do, but considered them to be horrible failures -- for the most part.  By the time the reception was over she was completely exhausted, and remained that way through Sunday.  Part of it was physical, but most if it was emotional.  I think that is due to her missing having her girlfriends to hang out with.  In high school she had Elizabeth, in college she had Jeannie -- now she doesn't really have that type of friend.  Jeannie does live near by, but she is always busy with work, family and all the activities that Keye plans.  So, it is just really hard to see her enough, as far as Kelly is concerned.  As if I am not demanding enough to take up all her time.  Guess I will just have to come up with something.

I have a few more leads for jobs -- and I got my AMS phone interview here in about half an hour.  So the job thing is looking up.  But still, no offers.

Still haven't been feeling too well, so if the doctor was right -- and this is just allergies -- then the rain today should help.  I still have a hard time sleeping, and Kelly thinks I am silly for stopping taking Entex.  I may go back on it if the Sudafed doesn't help. I just wish it had been a sinus infection and I could have gotten the antibiotics and been better in 24 hours.  I have never had allergies like this before.  My nose doesn't run at all, it is all draining down my throat.  Not too pleasant.

I haven't been to wushu since Wednesday,  and I don't think I will be going tonight.  Tomorrow is the good day -- but I don't know if I can handle both sword and gymnastics.  I'll prolly try going anyway.

I was watching a commercial for the new FOX reality show Mr. Personality.  All they guys wear masks and the girl will marry one with out ever seeing his face.  Well, at the end of the commercial one of the guys takes off his mask and is supposed to be real good and ugly (I agreed).  But what I was thinking was wouldn't it suck to be the ugly guy.  I mean they did a casting call for an ugly person and someone thought "hey, I am ugly!" and went out to audition.  Then the people that hired him just reinforced that the thought he was properly ugly.  That has got to reak havoc on one's self image.  If I am ugly, don't' tell me, I would much rather live on in my little world considering my self a non-un-attractive person.  It's got to be healthier that way.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Wushu was pretty good on Tuesday.  I was not too out of it from this allergies thing -- a little flemy, but I was able to train pretty good.  My muscles started cramping up real bad on scales, in particular my left hamstring.  It's not even the supporting leg, but just holding out my leg -- and that muscle just cramps up.  The worst part of it is it is still hurting two days later, feels like I pulled it.  I was talking to Carlos about it and he seems to think it is because I am dehydrated, so I figure that I must be dehydrated because of all these allergy meds I am taking.  Plus I realized that I haven't been drinking that much water recently.  So I have set a new goal for the near future: Drink hella lotsa water.

Interviews are going great.  I had my interview with Pearl Software yesterday up in Baltimore.  It was prolly the best interview I have ever had.  It went really smoothly and I think I represented my self pretty well -- plus I liked what I heard about the company.  My luck doesn't end there.  I have since had 3 interviews set up for Friday.  It's gonna be a busy day, I don't have much time between interviews and there is some distance to drive so it is going to be interesting.  Lockheed from 8:30 to Noon, AMS at 1 to 3, and Value Options at 4.  That's a full day, and I am going to have to pack a lunch to eat in the car.  The AMS one is really important, and I don't like having it sandwiched in-between because if they want me to stay longer I would like to, so that I can continue to (try to) impress them, and thus get that ever-so-important offer.  I'm still waiting to hear form Booz.

I expect to get offers from Lock-mart, Pearl, AMS and Booz.  If I do that well I am gonna be all sorts of happy with my self.  Needless to say the job market is much better, well, either that or my resume is much better.  Nah, must be the market.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Very long and eventful weekend.  I had my marathon interview schedule on Friday.  From that I have decided that AMS is probably my first choice and the Value Options BSA position sounds like a horrible job, and I had to struggle to sit there and act interested.

The AMS interview went really well, I really liked the guy who would be my manager ' ex-navy pilot ' and the work and work-environment sounds almost exactly like what I would want.  They are supposed to call me today.  So I am sitting here (still at DCS) hovering over the phone, waiting for a call.

Friday night I went to wushu, pretty good.  Coach wasn't there, she had to go do something, so Stephan took over.  IT was a decent class, we worked pretty hard ' mostly doing sections.  I am a tornado-split wuss, I know I could make it.  I would nail it if I would simply go for it, but I don't.  Because I am a wuss.  A tornado-split wuss.

Saturday I skipped wushu, Kelly wanted me to go to Jeannie's BBQ at 2 on time.  I broke down because I didn't want to drive home separate.  Good thing too, we had a few drinks, it blossomed into a game of caps and then a game of three man.  We wound up heading home around 2 or 3.  It was actually a lot of fun, I kinda felt bad for Sean, being completely sober and seemingly uninterested in out activities ' but he claims he was un-bored.

Sunday we followed up Saturday with our own BBQ, and had some of the fellas from IMAKE over.  Neil and James came over and we cooked a few burgers and hung out.  Kelly and I felt like we fell a little short and didn't entertain so well, kinda got boring there at the end.  Despite trying to break out the cheap ass games and playing a few rounds of Give me the Brain.

I'll try to update again today with some real insight, but these last few weeks have lead to a lot of thought along the lines of what I want to do for the rest of my life and what is (and is not) acceptable for a career.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[This whole not-going-to-work thing is so much better when you have a job lined up.  There are so many things I need to get done and lots of stuff to do, but when I was in full time job-hunting mode I couldn?t worry about them.  Looking for a job take much more time than actually having one.

Right after I accepted my position at AMS I got a call from lockheed and they wanted to extend me an offer.  I Almost went through and completed the paperwork so I could see what they would give me, but I wanted this AMS thing so I took it.  I guess the smart thing would have been to not accept until I had everything in front of me, but I seriously doubt that they could beat the money and I know I like the commute to AMS much better.

I went down to Richmond with Kelly on tuesday night, she had to be back up here for Wednesday so we went down monday night and came back up Tuesday afternoon.  I missed Sword class and Gymnastics, but I will make up for wushu because I can go to day classes for the next week or so, and I will try to make it out to the Gym tonight after wushu for a little tumbling.  Hopefully Carlos will be there tonight.  If all else fails I can work on some tumbling at O-Mei with their snazzy little floor.

Richmond was good. I hung out with my parents. I got the call from AMS saying they were gonna give me a job. Then I went to best buy and blew a lot of money on a Clie. Got to see my rather round sister (due in July, I think). Played with Jacob.  Washed Kelly's car.

Actually it was while I was washing Kelly's car that I noticed a bulge in one of her tires.  I didn't remember to change it until we were on our way home on I-95, so we pulled off at exit 104 and changed it to the spare -- thus I was late and didn't make it to gymnastics.

Lots to do.  Like playing outside in the sunshine and capturing wedding video.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I don't know what I did, but yesterday while changing my pants my shoulder started hurting.  I didn't have any pain that I noticed at all before hand but something funny happened and now I have a very strong pain in my deltoid when ever I lift my arm up.  It's like a little "string" of muscle hurts.  It dosen't seem to be effected by the load, it hurts the same with or with out lifting any weight.  I wonder if it is a nerve thing.   Kelly did point out that it could be from when Neal and I were playing on the big playground at church.  We were doing some crazy stuff.

Easter Weekend was very nice.  We stayed in DC until Saturday afternoon, so that I would have time to to go Wushu and kelly could bake some bread.  We grabbed some great BBQ at Old Hickory Grill in Loemanns's plaza -- I cannot believe that I used to spend so much time in Loemanns plaza and would never go to that place.  It's pretty stinking good.  After all the BBQ fun time, we wound up going out to the 'dorf.  Sanded my spear since I had access to Kelly's dad's orbital sander.  Church was pretty nice, GSPC has a very familiar and welcome feel.  Little kids are around, but not overpowering, Don has good sermons, and my wife really likes it.  There are some great things about our monster of a church, but I can appreciate the close church family that GSPC has.  It is a much better distributed load than any other church I watched my parents participate in while growing up. Those churches always seemed to abuse a select few people and make them do all the work.  Often those people were my parents.

I am very annoyed at this shoulder thing right now.  I am supposed to be going to wushu in an hour and a half.  Not gonna happen.  Kelly is also not sure I should go to Richmond with her -- she is worried I will be bored.  Since my parents will be out of town I don't have anyone that I really could hang out with.  I will call Jason and/or Amiee tonight to see if the would be free tomorrow and the next day.  If my shoulder is in pain still then there is little I can do up here other than see a doctor.  If it feels better then I have gymnastics and wushu I can hit up during the day and evenings -- with testing the weekend and team trials and cirque auditions soon I could really use this time off to train.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today was a bit off. I got smacked by cameron in go in an even game (that little punk plays too much).  I got to go to gymnastics during the day and things were worse than they were on tuesday.  Wushu was ma ma hu hu.

Gymnastics was pretty cool (aside from being off my game), apperently carlos teaches a couple of the adult women during the day time.  We almost had the entire gym to our selves, which was very cool.  I started out with my normal tumbling and had a bad pass -- I went kinda loose and it spooked me.  So I sat and stretched for a while.  Carlos -- like any good coach -- harassed me for not doing anything and had me practice round off back hand spring off the rod floor into an 8" mat.  Which was fine, until I went back to the normal floor.  Damn, I tumbled fast and high.  The 8" mat forced me to jump up too much so I continued doing that and I flew.  So awkward and spooky.  Groveling in my own defeat, I went and played on the tramp for awhile.

I really need to buckle down and drill the hell out of that tumbling stuff.  not to mention that i really should try it on the cheerleading floor soon to get used to the hard surface thing.  If I would stop being a pansy about it I am sure I could get a good layout in a week or two.  It really hurt when I found out that one of the new guys at the tuesday night class had only been tumbling 6 months.  I am about the same level as he is (as far as technique), but he has a few skills down that I haven't gotten the nerve up to try.  That is almost as bad as loosing two games in a row to cameron in Go.  Few month ago I could smack him around -- now the master has become the looser.  A dorky looser that stays up late playing online Go.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Ok, my shoulder got better from the mystery pain from last weekend, but on friday night (last night) I was doing that little roll from you back to your belly fish flop thing (if you saw it you would understand) and now my shoulder is killing me.  Prolly the fact that I tested today at wushu dosen't help too much -- I really aggravated it proper.  It was not too bad during the actual forms, but it was gradually more noticeable after each form.  By the time I finished staff -- the last form -- it was killing me.

Testing was pretty good.  If anything it got me much more fired up for training.  Coach gave a little speech at the end that really hit it dead on.  Basically she said that we lacked desire and determination -- we need to go out there and really think we are the best, and that no matter what be determined to win.  Not that winning is all important, but if you are settling for second before you even compete then you don't "want it" nearly enough.  I have got to want it more -- if I want to be good at this sport you got to be determined to go all out and own it.  Other wise it will show.

Besides having that hear/sprit/desire/qipo there were a few technical details -- I need to work on tempo, rhythm and explosiveness.  I totally lack that "wha-BAM! look at this" -- Which would require me to roll up all of the above and cram it into my wushu.

Must stick my tornado split.

On the up side I now have a Purple Belt in wushu.  Heh, wushu isn't supposed to have belts -- but if I am testing I might as well go up the ranks.  Silly worthless belts, don't even get me going on that rant again.

Took kelly out on a proper date tonight.  That was a lot of fun -- we have not gone out recently enough.  We saw <i>Chicago</i> from the front row of a packed theater.  I am gonna have to watch that again on a TV so I can see what was actually going on.  We had to turn our head up just shy of 90 degrees to see the top of the screen.  So close. We then split some fajitas and sopapillas for dinner at Chevys.

Now lets go bust out the sports medicine books for shoulder injuries.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Yesterday was my first day, but that was nothing but employee orientation.  Today is my first real day of work -- but I don't have any real work to do yet.  My Manager is out on vacation and my computer is gonna be completely redone tomorrow, so any changes I make will be whipped out.  Not too much I can do at this point.  Some new employee paperwork and online training and that's about it.

So, I distract my self by looking out the nice big window admiring the trees.  I may be stuck on a conference room on the top floor with all the exec types, but it sure beats a cube in a converted warehouse right next to the projects.  There wasn't even a window that would let me look out at the projects.

Oh, it's official, Cirque wants me to come show off on the 16th of May.  I have to be at a gymnastics gym in the middle of NYC at 8 a.m. on a Friday morning -- this is gonna be interesting.  I will probably get a hotel up around there, but I still don't know how or where anything is up there'anyone wanna come with me -- this sorta thing is less nerve racking with company there.

With Cirque fast approaching and my shoulder healing slowly I need to decide if I risk gymnastics and wushu tonight.  My shoulder doesn't hurt now -- but it 'wanted' to hurt yesterday, although it was not painful, merely noticeable.  However Sunday while I was teaching it did hurt quite a bit -- and teaching is rather low impact compared to actual training.

My injuries have bad, bad timing.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[The job is going well, tomorrow I get to go down to the customer site and finally get something to do.  Other than random paper work I have spent most of my time just chillin here.  Most of that chillin is concentrating on my shoulder.  I still don't have a clue what is wrong with it, but it is defiantly wrong.  I am going to a Chinese Doctor tomorrow and hopefully he can help or at least know what it is.  I would go see my regular doctor, but I have a feeling that he would just tell me to not do anything with it ' so I will go to him if the Chinese guy doesn't know what is going on.  But by then I will be in NYC.  After that I can rest.  Well team trials, but that is a bit in the future.  Cirque is very soon, like almost now.

I did try to go to wushu last night, but the pain was overwhelming by the end of class.  I really want to go to gymnastics tonight since Carlos will be gone next week ' but the last thing I need to tumble while distracted.  I am not good enough at gymnastics to do that.  I have to concentrate on exactly what I am doing and do that.  Must concentrate on going back on the round-off to handspring and then punching off the floor and going up.  My internal monologue is something like 'go back-go back-go back'arms up-arms up'.yeah!', sometimes I replace that 'yeah' with a solid 'crap' ' and that tends to be more 'out loud' than internal.

When not fretting over my current physical state I have been playing with my Clie.  I got all the odd todd animations ' it's really cool playing those the PDA, they look nice and sound great.  That is almost a better feature than the mp3's.  Almost but not really.

'.

Finally met the boss.  Said I don't have anything to do right now so I should go home.  Cya.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I actually had a very good end of the week experience.  Well everything except for the dream I had on Friday night.  That spooked me.

But first the other stuff.  I am pretty sure that if you have read this log in the last few weeks you knew about the shoulder pains.  I have not been too happy with that whole situation.  Well, coach convinced me to go see her brother who is a Chinese doctor.  This Acupuncturist did a very detailed and thorough inspection ' moving my shoulder in every possible position, jabbing it with his thumb, pressing and twisting all the bones and muscles asking if I had any pain.  Which I didn't have (at least as a result of the poking and prodding), but I did realize how much more effort this guy went through than a western doctor would have for a similar injury.  Plus he actually attempted treatment.  Yes, that involved sticking needles in me.  In my shoulder to be exact.  The best part wasn't the actual sticking of the needles or the very hot UV lamp he put over my shoulder, but when he hooked the needles up to a power supply and ran electricity through them.  The Doctor kept asking me if I could tolerate it ' but he never turned it up past a strong twitch.  Hmmm, more of a tickle than twitch.  After lying on my side (in the dark listening to soothing music) for quite some time in a rather awkward position he sat me up and proceeded to thoroughly and mildly painfully massage my shoulder.  As far as I know that helped as much as the actual sticking of needles.  Maybe it was a combination of the two or some miraculous heeling from God that happen to kick in at the same time ' but I felt much better after that.  I went easy on my shoulder for the rest of the day, and the following day we did some filming but I only held the camera.  A few days earlier an hour or two of holding the camera would have caused plenty of pain but I felt at most mild discomfort.  Sunday I was able to teach my wushu class with no problems, whereas the week before I was hating any and all arm movements.  When you teach little kids and you show them a movement and you only use one arm they also only use one arm.  Doesn't matter if you tell them otherwise, they see you and copy that.

Gerald and Sean wound up crashing at my place all weekend, which was fun.  There were copious amounts of contact juggling and kung fu movies.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Back to the dream.  I don't know what I ate on Friday, but I don't want to eat it before bedtime any more.  I had this dream, a dream where I could imagine people.  Like imaginary friends, and as far as I was concerned they were as real as I wanted them to be.  So I could be chilling at home bored, and then decide I wanted some company so there was a knock at the door and look some new friends.  A handy power to have.  Until it all goes horribly wrong, and the scary thing was in the dream things continued to seem pleasant and good even when it took a turn for the worse.  I was loosing my ability to tell the imaginary people from the real people.  It was humorous and strange to the real people (that poop UPS guy), and I knew it wasn't a good thing -- but in the context of the dream it was not bad.

When I finally woke up and realized that I had just been schizophrenic I freaked out.  I was really worried that I was gonna start imagining people.  Luckily I realized that I don't actually do that, nor have I ever.

'sept for that Leprecon that told me to burn things, but that is another story.

Thinking you have suddenly become schizophrenic is not nearly as fun as is sounds, or as it seems while you are still dreaming -- it will spook you when you wake up. Lying in bed testing to see if you can imagine someone else.  So happy that you can't, but worried that you imaginary friend is just sleeping downstairs and doesn't want to come up in the middle of the night'.so you go down stairs and discover the strange man sleeping on your foof'.turns out to be Sean.  Whew.

I like not having any major mental illnesses.  Yessir I sho do.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I had a good class last night.  Still haven't worked on any of the choreography for the new/modified forms for the audition - and I may wind up doing the vanilla compulsory forms with only a few modifications (i.e. no front sweep after the butterfly).  But I did a few round off-back handsprings and then reluctantly attempted a backtuck on the 4th pass - Nailed it.  Such a good feeling. The last two weeks at gymnastics my shoulder was hurting and I was preoccupied with causing it more pain, so of course my tumpling sucked.  I wouldn't set up, I would bend my knees and throw my head back on the back tuck and it was overall sloppy.  But I hit it at wushu, on that unpadded (yet suspended) floor, in shoes and everything.  Good feeling.

While my shoulder is much, much better, I did do something to my knee.  Nothing scary like the shoulder injury -- but rather annoying.  It has happened before -- sorta a zingy nerve thing.  Inside my knee and shoots down my shin.  Hurts to scoot my chair forward or take off my shoes.  But walking is fine, and it only bothers me a little at wushu.  I will ask the Chinese Doctor about it when I go back there today.

Work is going very well, I really like the people I am working with. We were supposed to have a happy hour Wednesday, but I scheduled my Appointment with Charlie then so I am going to miss it. That really stucks, but I will make sure to go out to the next one.  If it wasn't for this appointment I could hit the happy hour out in Ballston and still make it back in time for wushu at 7 - especially with Kelly out of town tonight that would have been some snazzy scheduling on my part.  But now it sucks that Kelly will be away on a not-regurly-scheduled day, CapOne has her in Williamsburg for some sorta forced fun.  But on the up side she was here last night -- when she normally would have been in Richmond.

She travels way too much for the company.

Imma off to try and concentrate on finding work -- even though I will prolly daydream about wushu and my audition for most of that time.  But hay! No more fretting about my shoulder.  Yay!]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I think acupuncture gives me weird dreams.  I had that schizo dream last Friday after my first session, and last night I had a strange dream where I couldn't open my right eye.  Then my left one started to stick and was getting harder and harder to open.  Not much fun.

Poke me with a needle and call me dumb.  I didn't mention the zip-zangy knee pain until after the acupuncture was all finished and the doctor said I shoulda told him earlier because he could have helped it.  It's crazy cool having a doctor that specializes in Wu Yi (martial arts medicine).

I wound up going home with out training.  Not that I should be training right after getting treated -- however I don't know for sure because I forgot to ask the doctor if it was ok.  But the people I talked to said I shouldn't.

I did find the gym in the basement of AMS, pretty nice setup.  They got the free weights and showers that I would want (squat rack, yay!) -- now if I am gonna lift I need a spotter.  But if I wanna go to wushu at lunch I can return and shower before returning to the small conference room.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I had a pretty good weekend.  All my forms are set and I am getting pumped for cirque.  T-Minus 4 days.  Not that I am nervous  (I am), but my legs bounce up and down all day long.

Friday and Saturday wushu were pretty good, but by Saturday my lower legs were killing me.  If I am not very careful they hurt, but I have gotten to the point that I can prevent the shin pain if I simply condition and train smart.  Pushing for this cirque thing doesn't tend allow me time to worry about my shins.  At least my shoulder and knee are back to normal -- nice happy and pain free.

I have only altered my Chang quan form in the second section, took out the butterfly-front sweep and put in a twist.  Unfortunately I don't do a front sweep or body turn in the form now, a couple of things I thought were pretty good.  I want to thro an aerial into my staff form, but I am not sure that the tornado after I do a aerial looks good enough.  If I leave out the aerial my tornado is much better.  So, I will probably just do the plain old staff form.  Sword is not getting changed at all.

 The powerful hunger pangs I am having are preventing my creative process so I am gonna go deal with that.  Perhaps I will get inspired and can return to type some inspired-ish words up.   Actually, I will prolly sit pre-occupied with bigger more life changing events.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Well I get on the train at 5:37 today.  Excited like you wouldn't believe.  I have gotten good-luck's from all sorts of people - everyone at wushu and at kelly's office.  Not to mention all my family that is rooting for me.

I really hope I can write up everything that goes on there and actually give some honest insight into the process.  It seems that everyone that I know that has auditioned is very secretive about telling others what went on there.  I think the point is to prevent anyone from having an advantage they didn't have.  Which is reasonable.

It is along those same lines I am pretty frustrated.  Cirque gave a blanket invite to this audition to the students at Omei.  So we now have 3 other people that are going to the audition that would not have gone if they had to put any real effort into the process.  One of those people even has not intention of going even if they get an offer - something about becoming a doctor instead.  I know it is very selfish of me, but I did but amazing amounts of effort into getting headshots taken, shooting and editing a demo video and polishing up my resume.  And now these people can just stroll in and their chances are just as good as mine.  I don't want to take it away, and I even encouraged them to go, but on the inside I was screaming "don't go!  It'll hurt my chances!!!!"  and I was hoping that they wouldn't.

I guess it is somewhat understandable, I have always wanted to do something like this, long before I started martial arts or even attempted any sort of acrobatics.  I don't wanna be selfish and unfairly hurt other people's chance to go, but I feel like it has been unfair to me.  I mean I did do all that work and clearly have more desire for this - but some people sorta waffled over even bothering to go.  It just boils down to the fact that I want this so bad and I am willing to completely dump my life that I have worked so hard to build for this chance.  It seems that everyone that just decided to go (who wouldn't have put the effort into a demo vid, etc) are not willing to sacrifice these sort of things - or course I can' only say that because most of them either A) Don't have a career, wife, etc or B) don't even intend on accepting an offer.  I know I am being unfair in these thoughts -- but by thoughts keep drifting back to how it is unfair to me.

When it comes down to it, if God wants me to go I will get in.   If I don't' get in, I will train hard and push for next time - but that seems like a pipe dream or a pitiful excuse.  In all reality there will probably not be a next time and I need to set my sights on something like the US team (which probably won't happen this year - so in 2 years.  And I am getting on the upper age limit for that sort of thing already)  I think someone need to haul off and punch me in the belly and tell me to quit my wining.  And I will quit. Now.  Awwww man.  Er, I mean - NOW!

I really like my current programming job, and I would be very happy doing it for quite a while and concentrating on developing my self into a coach.  And the goal for the US team is really directly related to that, I want that credential on my resume.  I feel like that sort of status will alow me to supercede my biggest crippling factor for being a wushu coach - being a white male.  Being able to speak Chinese will also help with this, but that doesn't go as far as having Cirque or the US team down on your school's brochure.

And honestly, what I really want is to have a school and be a really good coach.  I want to be that coach I wanted to find when I was growing up.  I do not want to get involved in wushu political bickering.  That last one may prove impossible.  Political bickering in the wushu world is prolly harder to eliminate than the mosquito problem in Alaska.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA["It's not that lack skills or are not good at what you do, but we don't see you in our new creation"  Or something like that.  I couldn't really hear exactly what he was saying because in my head I was screaming "no,no, No, NO, NO...NONONO!"  I had been screaming that in my head once they called my name out during our break.  Damn, that sucked -- I knew exactly what was coming once they asked "Christopher?" -- I wanted to say "No, that's Chris" but I accepted my fate and mumbled "yeah"

Walking across the floor to the reject circle sucked something hairy.  Not much fun. The worst thing was when the recruiter cam over and pointed out one of the guys and said "not him, he must stay."  I felt worthless.

It's not that I didn't have the skills.  I honestly, deep down feel like I could have lasted.  At least past the point that I did.  I was simply not being aggressive enough.  Much too timid during warm ups.  I had some one tell me to not do anything stupid and get hurt right at the beginning -- just as I was prepping to get ready to practice a little tumbling.  I was nervous about trying so I listened.  I figured I would save that for later.  Don't ever save it till later, there might not be a later.  That person who told me to play it safe also got cut.  Not that it matters in anyway -- what matters is I need to smack my timid little ass into gear and go all out.  Own that biznitch.  The Chinese people there totally ran the show.  They didn't listen to the recruiter -- they did what ever they could when they thought they should.  The rest of us held back so much compared to them.  And I held back compared to everyone.

I am not gonna play that what if game.  I am not gonna grovel in my own filth -- no matter how much I REALLY WANNA.  I was being a wuss.  I had the stuff I needed and I didn't throw down.  I got discouraged because when I showed up there were a lot of really good people there.  It was just like when I am playing Go, unless I am totally dominating the game I feel as if I am loosing.  Well I felt that same way.  I got discouraged and didn't fight for it.

Of course it wasn't that I didn't try at all (just not hard enough) -- it could be that I lack the talent.  But I am gonna pretend that is not the case and train my ass off.

I have not been able to validate my talent/skills in any arena that I would consider a true test. This was one of those arenas -- but I failed to validate myself here.  I want to get out there and prove to my self that I can hang with the guy.  My next chance will be at US Team Trials ... serious training begins for that today.  However I don't know if I am gonna be ready in 3 months or it I am really going for the on in 2 years.  Being 25 now, doesn't bode well for the one in 2 years, but I am going to do what I can and see if I am just fooling my self or if I can measure up.

It just sucks to think about last Friday.  Lets try to not remind me.  Please.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I went through the effort of typing up some stuff on [Raffi's](http://boards.gamers.com/messages/overview.asp?name=raffi&page=1) message board in response to GW's post (on 05/15/03):
<blockquote class="quote">
If you think about it, for MOST of the mainstream athletic events that get things like...oh, say TV COVERAGE (where the money comes in), there is one thing that they usually have in common: a connection to the non-athlete at some participatory level.

For example, Joe schmuck CAN get some clubs and golf, shoot hoops, throw a football, ..hell, they can even strap on a pair of skates and get the feeling of what ice skating might be like. they can shadow box and even pretend spar.

Gymnastics...it captured the US imagination with the perfect 10s and such..but it is NOT a big every week draw...you don't see the Gymnasts on tour like Ice Capades.

Wushu - common Joe Schmuck looks at it and is impressed. May even try to do something...and rips a groin muscle or worse. The "I could do that if I wanted to ..." fantasy just won't be there.

But Taijiquan....they CAN do...it COULD have the same appeal as yoga - with marketing. And it COULD lead people to other forms of Wushu and promote everything....

But it won't if no one ever sees it or if it is excluded from being a viable thing to do.

Seems shortsighted all around to me.
</blockquote>

And I responded by saying:
<blockquote class="quote">

There are some very good ideas, but I think the "I can do that" syndrome needs more too it.

First, you seem to show that yoga is an example of a success story -- but I don't see how that is doing any better than taiji is.  Perhaps it is more popular in health clubs, but I don't see it as a huge fad, at least in this part of the country.

Of course my sample data for this is skewed, I do know 2 people that do yoga, but you can't count the number of taiji people I know because I happen to go to schools that teach that.

The main thing that I think is important is that people should be able to look at modern wushu and relate closer than they could with other sports -- even the ones that have gotten plenty of airtime and money thrown their way.  You said that if anyone tried to imitate wushu that they would hurt themselves.  I think this is less likely to happen imitating wushu than say, skateboarding, mountain biking or rock climbing.  Which all get featured on ESPN.  People would have a higher chance of getting hurt playing full contact tackle football than trying to imitate contemporary wushu, I think.  People go play two-hand touch ' AKA a nice watered down version.  Anyone can do a nice watered down version of wushu.  No kicks above your thigh, keep the jumps to a comfy hop or two and swing your arms around.

Yes, I agree, with different marketing wushu could become very popular.  Unfortunately    (It's only unfortunate if you want wushu to become popular) there is no financial backing to such a marketing campaign.  With such a push a lot of things would change in the process.  There are many different ideas of how wushu should exist, and this marketing force would force it's particular flavor upon the public ' and I am sure that plenty of people would be unhappy about this.  Everyone talking about how old-school wushu is so much better than the bastardized wushu that everyone else does, not that this isn't already happening.

I think the important question is not how do we market wushu, but rather do we want wushu to become popular.  Not just popular, but do we want it to go through that full metamorphosis that will produce the mainstream American bastardized version of wushu?  I am all about the grassroots movement that wushu has now.  I want to see the level of wushu improve and continue to evolve ' but I am skeptical about it becoming mainstream.

Most of the ideas I am actually in favor of, but I am playing devil's advocate -- there are some issues that could really ruin things for everyone if not actively resolved.

Now if we have any ideas for marketing of a privately own wushu school, I am all about that.  Preferably, a way that doesn't involve blanketing cars with flyers.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I has a strange dream that my jeep was stolen.  Jason and I were walking out to the parking lot and noticed my jeep was missing a door ' some how that translated into the jeep being stolen.  Doesn't matter too much because Jason was there and we were able to track down the thieves ' we caught up with 2 of them and they were hanging my hood and some interior stuff up on trees.  So we tackled them and held them down.  The one I tackled pulled out a grenade and pulled the pin.  But I picked it up and threw it into a deep valley.  We tied them up and I stayed there to make sure they didn't get away.  Jason went off and found the 3rd person and my jeep.  He returned shortly with the cops and the rest of the dream consisted of me worrying about my poor abused jeep and the insurance to cover it.  Apparently it was not totaled, and the cost of repairs was quite low given the amount of damage it had.

Hurt my food doing tornado split last night.  Strange twisting sidewise forces and that joint in the middle of the food now hurts.  Not too painful but pretty annoying.

That guy Lucas I met in China is now going go O Mei.  He was supposed to still be in China now, but SARS sent him home.  I guess there just isn't enough wushu in upstate New York, because he is going to rent a dorm room at mason for a few months and train here.  Apparently Peter was talking about doing the same thing, but he blew his ACL (Aiya!) and is out for some time.  That really sucks.

I am gonna try to make it to team trials class today, but that starts at 3 so I am gonna have to skip out of work early to do so.  I did come in early so that shouldn't be to much of a problem.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Seriously, the Banach-Tarski Paradox hurts my head.  Stupid Spheres.  First it is absurd, then it gets confusing.  Right when it starts to make sense I get confused again.  Then bam it hits you in the head and you understand but your head now hurts.

You know carrying a palm with you is great, a central place that you can keep all the information you need that will go out into the world and sync with other information sources so you data gets replicated and is promised a long life of usefulness.  Until you run out of battery.  I had to call people up and tell them important passwords in order to get a phone number yesterday.  Not that I don't trust them, but I felt like an idiot for not having this number down where I could get to it.  Or maybe I was an idiot because I didn't charge my PDA's batteries.

Wushu is actually going well.  Everyone is all consumed by team trials these days.  And I am definitely not the exception.  When we are not training for them we are talking about them.  Always speculating on who will show up, who is a shoe-in for a spot, what we have to do in order to get really good really fast so we can get a spot.  Sometimes it is discouraging -- wushu is just too hard and I am never going to get that extra boost of skill I need to score a team jacket.  But I front kick my self in the head and push harder.

My current wushu goal: master tornado splits.

This is the skill I need now.  I must get this if I am going to do well.  It is one of those wushu tricks that many people use to separate the men from the boys.  It's about time to go through wushu puberty and become a wushu man.  (It's ironic if you think about it, once you have gone through wushu puberty and have the skill to bust a cleat tornado split your voice will probably get all high pitched and cracky -- a strong contrast to the more conventional puberty.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Well I didn't make it to long weapon class last night.  A dinner thing mostly. Turns out to not matter that much because when I showed up to give Stephan his sword coach wasn't even there. It looked like a pretty slack class.  I am going to try to go this afternoon at 3 fro the team class if nothing comes up here at work.  I really like those classes, and I can't make it on Saturday because of Neal's black belt testing in Waldorf. So I am trying for this afternoon and Sunday morning.

The dinner thing was fun.  Kelly harassed Jeannie and Kai out to the daily grill.  Good food.  I downed the pot roast and chased it with a massive slice of cheese cake.  Poor Kai, on his Adkins diet -- just sat and watched me eat it.  I offered him some, but he grunted a "No."

I haven't been to gymnastics since Cirque.  I think I am avoiding it on purpose.  Well, I am starting to feel that internal pressure to get back there and make sure I don't loose what I have learned.  I was really pushing the gymnastics skills in the past few months.  I think I am going to go push wushu skills for a while.  I still need to drill the traditional gymnastics tumbling and work on things like layouts -- but I mostly want to get my right leg landing out of a butterfly twist back and clean up a few things.

I have discovered that I can twist more on my tornados, but I need to work on a one leg landing now.  I fall over often if I try to land on one leg.  I can still do it with out too much trouble if I don't rotate - but I want both the 540 and the one leg landing.  Actually, I had felt that this landing out of a tornado thing is much less important that I used to until I was at the audition and some people had nice tornados.  My problem is that I don't really know how good mine is.  I will have to get some video and see.  I need to bust out the camcorder soon anyway and see what I do and do not like about my forms now.  If I wait any longer I may not have time to change stuff around.

I am feeling better about being smacked in the face by cirque.  I have talked to a few people that passed the other auditions and were serious contenders (at least in this country) for the spots we were going for.  Well, they think their chances are vaporware.  Too good to be true.  I can relate.  I wanted that gig so bad.

Ahem: Trials.

Right, right, back to the task at hand.  I have serious doubts about my chances.  But I am not gonna pull another shy audition. I am gonna own this.  Smack that biznitch around.  Yah!  Aaaahhh-yah!!  Ooooo....  Uh, woot...yay...*sigh*]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I just found out that Peter's wedding is this summer.  It's really depressing that I wasn't about to find about it until someone mentioned it on Raffi's message board.  And not even someone that knows Peter or even lives on this side for the country.  I miss hanging out with him - and I did try hard to get in touch with him but I couldn't ever get a response.  He used to be my best friend up in the area (and Kelly really loved him too), but politics appear to have ended that.  I am really happy for him and his woman, I really do want to see him do well.  It just sucks that I have not been able to be there at all.  I mean, who else has such a proactive interest in Wushu, PS2, Legos, Wushu, sci-fi books, Taiji, and Jet Li movies.  I still think about him on a regular basis and want to call, but I think I will only get depressed if I try.  Perhaps I will give it another shot, it would be worth it if I could see him again.

We have also gone a while with out seeing some of our other wushu friends.  Mostly Paulo, Mel, Greg and Glenn -- or those were they guys we would see on a pretty regular basis, but haven't in a while.  Not much point to harass them to get together when I really have very little free time as it is.

Coach was up in Baltimore this entire weekend -- starting Thursday.  So we have all be slacking off in class.  Not that I didn't try to push hard, but with out the coach there you just don't tend to.  It's like human nature, you can't.  I have been working on staff, trying to get that in shape.  I think it is getting better, but I still need more explosion.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Reason people train.  What martial arts are good for.  Original ideas. What America produces.

These are all things I want to write about.  I really ought to outline the topics before I write, because just like this post once I start writing they sorta saunter off in a strange direction despite my intentions.  I want to get certain ideas across but in the process of writing I realize that my ideas are either poor ideas to begin with or get distracted with topics that are easier to explain or sound more insightful.  I really should make this journal thing private so I can write and not feel like I am doing it for anyone but myself.  But I find I express more and write more if there is the potential for an audience.  So public is a good mechanism for getting me to do want I set out to do.  Plus there is no information in here that is actually useful to anyone 'sept me, so no one should actually be reading, but they do.  Must be strange sick people that have posh corporate jobs like me that lurk around desperate for stimulation.

<hr width=75% size=1>

According to my interpretation of [Larry's rants](http://www.geocities.com/zgstunts/rants.html) I am not a stupid person. Maybe I shouldn't go that far, I am a stupid person.  I admit it.  But surprisingly I agree with a lot of the same things he does.  I have had very similar thoughts and ideas - but I come from a totally different background.  (I should also note that I have never had these original ideas on my own, they were all derived from other people original ideas.  More likely blatantly stolen.)

I almost went and typed up a nice little email to tell him something along those lines, but I couldn't come up with a way to composing it in a way that would be better than a prepubescent fan boy would.  Not that I have anything against them, but I would prefer to keep out of that stereotype.  If I aspire to be an intellectual that isn't, I should refrain from banging out emails to people I don't know and have no helpful/meaningful information to pass on to them.  Plus I am a poor speller and that might enrage him.

All right.  I actually finished reading all the rants now.  I was writing this stuff down as I was reading.  Mostly because I would think of something as I read and have a desire to write it down, lest I forget.  Perhaps I will send him an email.  The trick is to write it in an original way with original thoughts.  But I have none of those right now.

<hr width=75% size=1>

A few months ago I set out on a quest to expand my vocabulary.  There were a few words that I really liked - very expressive in the English language.  But I have lost the list for words that I had vowed to commit to long-term memory and I cannot remember them.  I remember what they mean, but it really sucks when you know there is a word for explaining the exact meaning for an idea that takes a more than a few sentences to convey.  I guess I will spend some time on dictionary.com and see if I can figure out what they were.
Reason people train.
-Trendy/Cool
-Discover who they are (How can you know who you are unless you have been in a fight)

What martial arts are good for.
-Why the martial aspect is more worthless now
-Unique way it brings certain types of people together

Original ideas.
-Why must I steal?

What America actually produces.
-Nothing
-Services
-Entertainment]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Things at work have been going very fast recently.  Or rather I have actually had real work to do.  First important issue, and I think I am handling it pretty well.  I am certain I can make my boss/team happy with the results.  Even with work that causes me to work 14-hour days (last Thursday) I am extremely pleased with my new job.

This weekend was pretty hectic.  Friday we had the planned surprise trip to Wolftrap to see Pirates of Penzance ' Kelly didn't figure out what was going on until the last moment.  The cover story worked out well, and we (Jeannie, Kai, and Kelly's 'rents) had a good time.  First night in weeks it didn't rain, nearly perfect weather for Wolftrap.

Saturday I was the only person that trained from 1 to 5 at wushu.  Other people did go to both classes, but they showed up very late (like almost an hour late) to the 1 pm class.  Demo practice was wedged in between regular class and team training.  I was dead by the end of it.

So I ran home (late) and jumped in the shower and we headed to Louis's graduation party in Springfield, some good Mexican food.  Sat and chatted with the in-laws.  Took off early to head to Richmond.

We had a free hotel room for the night because of the Marriott points that Kelly earns so we went there instead of my parent's place.  It was pretty nice, but we were both pretty tired and crashed hard.

Kelly got up the next morning and went to Target at 8 am to get presents for Laura's baby shower.  I should have gone with her, she spent lots of money on baby stuff ' but she bought me legos so I am not complaining.  After that, breakfast with my parents, lil sister, and Amiee.  The rest of the afternoon I hung out with my dad while the womens went to the shower.

Finished the day off with a trip to grandma's for dinner.  Headed back to NOVA, forgot Kelly's purse, drove back to Goochland and got it and finally went home for good.

At Grandma's House I got to play with my nephew.  He would jump and spin and kick around ' saying 'like on TV.'  My sister says he still watches my DVD. He kept asking for 'Chris' and I would run over and pay attention to him or play or jump and spin around.  So much fun.  He was even trying handstands after I showed him a few times.  It was great!  Jacob rocks.  I needa make a new DVD for him.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Crazy week all week.  I have been down on the client location for most of the week and things are just crazy with work.  Everything is going well so far, but the pace is much quicker.

Wushu is going well.  I drilled tornado split last night and I am getting better.  I spent some time watching and studying the 2001 China games compulsory forms to see how the pros do it.  I honestly think their compulsory forms lack flavor (especially if you compare them to their optional forms).  Still, they are better than the US.

Their tornado splits are insane, quite a few of them are fully split long before they hit the ground.  You see them dropping through the air just ready to slam into the ground.  I want that.

I think I am going to try to incorporate (read: steal) their style for the "double punch to back fist" at the end of section one.  Some of them pause after the two punches then throw out that back fist over the head thing.  The pause has a good flavor plus it allows you to get your footing before popping back up to the high empty stance.  Yeah, um, that's it!

If I can get my chang quan polished up a bit I will be happy.  The big thing to overcome is tornado split, of course.  But I also need to be consistent on my lotus and butterfly front sweep.  And clean up the set before the aerial (coach says I lean back)

The part of the Internet that is committed to wushu is all about team trials, specifically the scoring method to be used at the trials.  Right now the federation is using a sum-of-3-events way to determine your placement on the team.  Unfortunately this has a few side effects, like forcing taiji people to learn a long weapon.  I think the rules should be the exact same as worlds. Right now worlds simply awards medals for each event separately.  You can get a gold for Nan Quan or Spear or Broad Sword -- they don't average anything.

Because of this I think 2 events would give us better chances than 3. Or that 1 event might be even better. The point of having a team is to go to worlds (and pan am, to a lesser extent), so the entire things should be centered on succeeding at that tournament.

I understand that if we simply found the best competitor in each event we could have a skewed team, and each person might only be able to win in one event at worlds, and that if we averaged the scores we would get better rounded competitors (who might be able to win multiple medals from multiple events).  More events we average in, the better rounded the competitors.

However if we have a sword prodigy show up and they get a '10' for that event, but full out suck on the long weapon and empty hand then the U.S. is passing up a chance for a VERY good shot at gold in sword at worlds.

Of course I am also swayed by what would increase my chances at making the team, but I honestly have no idea what would be better for me.  C'mon top 12!]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Weekend recap

Friday:  Nailed tornado split for the first time.  I mean, my hands touched some but I landed right down in the split.    No pain or nuttin, well, there was pain but nothing acute or directly related to that skill.  Or course on the next run I hit my foot real hard on a front slap kick and bruised the ankle ' spent some time holding a cold coke can on my sweaty foot.  No one wanted the free coke.  I finished training, but sorta hobbled along on a few things.  Technique I used for doing the tornado split was after the slap just try to swing my legs apart into the split.  Makes me nervous thinking about it now, but it worked.

Saturday: Kelly was sick and didn't get to go to Six Flags with us.  I am glad she didn't come because the demo thing to the Martial Arts Channel was all crazy and we spent many hours standing out in the very hot sun.  Not to mention dealing with the trailer nazi.  Wound up doing 2 demos, the 3rd (which we didn't want to do anyway) was canceled due to a nasty thunderstorm. Not much thunder, but plenty of storm.  Taking into account that fact that we had prepared a 15-minute demo and they told us 4 1/2 minutes once we got there we did pretty well.  We did a demo of jumps and individual sets for the first one and our broadsword and sword group sets for the second.  Went pretty well,  I would like to do much better in the future, but hey we were all gonna pass out from heat stroke soon anyway.

Sunday: Spent with the wife.  We had lunch with her friend from work (Jen and Jarred), and followed that up with dinner at Maggiano's with her 'rents.  Hao chi. I waited till late that night to lift and stretch.

Today, I am cold and my foot still hurts some.  I get nervous thinking about tornado split.  But I have resolved to my self that I would rather not compete than compete and not be competitive.  If tornado split decides to hurt me then that is one thing, but if I compete I will have it down solid.

I don't like competition ' I don't' like how I feel before and during.  Not pleasant, but I have something to prove to my self and that is how I want to prove it.  I think that makes it worse.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I found this on [NWTC's news page](http://www.usawushu.com/resources/index.html):
<blockquote>
<b>July 2003</b>
Wushu in the Olympics
Unofficially, wushu has been accepted by the International Olympic Committee into the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing. IOC's next meeting is in Prague, Czech Republic on July 2nd. A formal announcement shall be made then.
</blockquote>
After reading all the announcements and reviews of potential sports that came out of the last few Olympic committee meetings I was pretty convinced that the Olympic wushu had no chance aside form China swinging it's political weight around to get it in.  And I was pretty sure that wasn't going to be enough.  In fact I saw a number of wushu coaches touting that is wall all but a sure thing, despite the fact that Wushu had been all out rejected by the IOC, only later to be put back into consideration because of (assumed on my part) pressure from China. So considering this along with the fact that the IOC does not want to increase it's over all sport count, thus requiring something else to be dropped, I was quite skeptical.  Do we really think the IOC will drop Baseball/Softball?  I sorta hope not, but I really do want (and think) wushu otta be put in.

This new announcement makes me optimistic, but I will not be convinced until I see the official announcement.

<i>On a more personal note: </i> My hip has been bugging me more and more, not that it has gotten worse, but I think I have been doing more things to aggravate (notice) it.  I think I am going to go back and see my Chinese Doctor, Charlie; he did wonders for my shoulder.  I don't understand how he does it, nor do I want to learn ' it might not work if I figure it out.  Stupid jian su.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Really good and really bad

It was really good to see bunch of our old friends at the demo yesterday.  We were doing the grand opening of the new O-Mei school in Maryland and all sorts of, um, non-O-Mei people showed up.  I don't want to get anyone in trouble, so no names will be mentioned, but it was really nice to see everyone and talk with them.  It seemed like people were honestly interested in how we were doing and what we were up to these days.  Very cool to see that people had been thinking about us - cause I know I put plenty of effort in pining for wushu-ren of yesteryear.  So many cool people that I wish I still could see in a regular basis.

And as icing on the cake we had a little gathering of the founding members of Peking Duck last night.  Glenn and Tom stopped by to borrow my camera, but we wound up hanging out for some time.  Earlier Sean and I had made practice rope darts.  Well, Sean had already made his, and I did have one, but I took it apart and made a new one. I was inspired by the Li Jin Heng video that Sean had bought.  So after the boys showed up we wanted to pratice a few rope dart tricks. It was right bout that time that Kelly kicked us out of the house (citing something about breaking the windows and/or TV).  Sean, Tom and I all trotted outside and continued to draw a small crowd of curious neighborhood children.  We proceeded to tangle our selves up for their entertainment, and in the process figure out a few moves of our own.  The best new trick: "Abe Lincoln" Tom and I can use our abnormally large ears and wrap the rope over one ear under the chin and over the other ear and back.  Gives a nice Abe Lincoln style rope beard.  In the end we determined that we suck at rope dart.

The really bad was how much flavor I didn't have during the demo.  I really lacked all pizzazz and qi-po and explosion.  And just to rub it in it seemed like everyone else had extra flavor in their forms.  I was really mono-tone in my movements.  My form had the same tempo of a digital design professors droning away about k-maps.  No umph.  I must fix it.  I know I don't always have the flavor of stale unsalted saltine crackers, but I sure did at the demo.  I really need to make more sound effects.  Not necessarily out loud, but when I think "raaahhhhh....BA-BAM!" I tend to relax when I need it and add that extra power and explosiveness to the right places.

Rizqi did a tight butterfly twist with a staff.  I didn't know he could do that.  Neither did he, apparently it was his first time.  And Zack has the cleanest and most consistent tornado split.

The bar keeps getting raised.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Yesterday was a good day.  The HVAC was broken here at work.  Well, that didn't make the day good, but it was crazy hot so we left early and I was able to wash and wax the jeep. That's one nice thing about working here, is I am across the street form my old apartment, and they have a car wash bay. I then proceeded to remove the top and doors and enjoy the sunny day.

Unfortunately Kelly was in Richmond, so that prevented it from becoming a great day - I mean, what good is the jeep if you can't use it to get girls?  And my girl wasn't anywhere near, so I went to wushu.

Sword class.  I felt good, lots of sound effects in my head.  I felt like I had more flavor.  We even did entire sets at the end - I had good time 1:25, but wanted to try it again because I knew I could do better.  Class ran long, coach gave use a big speech about not throwing weapons and respecting those older than you. And younger.  And same age.  Not a bad speech, but I wanted to get going so I could make it to Gymnastics.

I got Sean to go to Capital with me, and we rode there in style. He did twists into the pit.  I think he could land one on the floor if he came a few more times.  Bryan, also was training twists, he was even doing them on the floor.  He has this nasty habit of opening up when he is facing up - and that sends him skipping across the floor.  When he waits for it he lands just fine.

I didn't do too much, but I was able to do a few roundoff-backhandspring-backtucks with out incident.  I need to work on a few things like twist with staff and butterfly-butterfly twist (no steps!).  But those can all wait until July 28th.

 <hr />
I am having serious internal conflict as to weather or not I should [switch](http://www.fuzzymonk.com/chris/log/blog/) my log over to Movable Type from Blogger.  It is ridiculous that I am having issues with this, I mean, c'mon it's just a frikkin blog.  But never-the-less I am.  And I want to discuss the topic with someone, but no one I know (at least in real life) could care one way or the other.  I mentioned it to Kelly, and I think she choose blogger because it sounded cooler.  But blogger is having issues.  Not that movable type is pain free.  But I switched to using blogspot (the ad supported host for blogger) instead of fuzzymonk.com because the passive FTP of fuzzymonk.com would require me to hit 'publish' four or five times.  Lets not talk about the 'missing archives' issue it has.  Movable Type has it's advantages in that it is all run from and on fuzzymonk.com.  Of course that is also a bad thing if I think blogger.com is more likely to not crash and loose my data.  MT also has a bunch of more advanced features like search, extended posts, and comments.  I think I am going to wait and see for when they upgrade me to the new blogger system and choose then.

Paragraphs like that make me feel pathetically geeky.  But, really, what did you expect?

Oh, did you see the new [G5](http://www.apple.com/powermac/)'s?  Lust-o-meter pegged.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[New Mobo, Wushu Rank Revisited.

Gotta be careful with USB Mice, plug that in backwards and your mother board will smoke spark and smell really bad.  Unfortunately  (or fortunately, depending) that didn't make any difference as to getting the PS/2 ports to work.  After struggling to get a power supply that would actually provide enough power to boot I can't get the stinking keyboard to work.  Worked fine during installation, and now the Num Lock/Caps Lock/Scroll Lock LEDs just sorta dimly flicker.  I asked Google about it and found a few other people who had the problem.  Their solution was to use a USB keyboard or return the mobo.

It all started because I wanted to get my PC working again.  I don't know what the hell possessed me.  I should have saved my money and put it in my 'get another Mac' fund.  It took a computer engineer 3 days and twice my, er'his, budget to get it working.

I had been having problems with my old AMD 700 system from the day I got it.  It would randomly freeze.  It got to the point that it wouldn't find the keyboard or hard drive if it didn't feel like it.  So I thought I would replace the mobo and processor.  Went down to Micro Center and found a combo package with an AMD Athlon XP 1800+.  I had to go for a new power supply, and opted for a stick of DDR memory.  I paid a whipping $12.99 for 256 Megs.  I may go back to get another.  I remember when I was paying $3 a meg.

I angry computers.

Wushu sucked last night, but that is mostly my fault.  Not that I was unhappy with training, but my upper ham hurts.  That makes things less fun.  And coach wasn't there so we all slacked off.  Least it was staff.  The things I need to work on in staff seem much more obvious and easy to deal with.  Of course I should be working harder and get that form perfect.

<hr />

I was thinking about ranks in wushu again the other day.  We were comparing how things are done at O-Mei with USWA, and came to some interesting conclusions.  The most interesting is come from a comment I over heard, something along the lines of 'You don't have to test in order to learn new stuff.'

I think this makes a big difference.  I would like a system that 1) allows the rank to be reserved for people who actually deserve it.  Rank should only rewards people for skills are of the same level as everyone at that level.  But I also want a system that 2) encourages people of all skill levels to progress and keep learning, even if they know they will never be able to get the rank.  So what I need is a system that encourages people to learn while not necessarily progressing in rank.

The one thing about the current system is it seems good for beginners and kids.  It has a standardized structured curriculum that everyone must (and can) go through.  But once the fundamental basics are put in place, people now understand how to punch and kick and are ready to start learning different styles everything changes.  Now that the intermediate level is obtained (what I mean by intermediate is normally is the 'Advanced' class in most schools, but that level would be called intermediate in a tournament) thinks should change.  Certain people will still want to push hard and progress in rank, set personal goals and work their ass off to get them.  Lets not cheapen them by making their goal easier just because they worked hard for it.  Make it mean something.  And if they just want to learn more they can do it.  Once the coach understands that they have gotten their form to a place that is good relative to their skill level they should be allowed to learn more.  Of course quality control for this situation is hard and falls directly into the hands of the coach and they way he run things ' but it is not nearly as important because no rank is being given out for it.  This protects the coach form loosing face and allows everyone to continue learning.

I find it to be sad how many people quit because they are tired no waiting to finish their form and test, but the coach refuses because they require them to obtain a required skill level before they test.  Like I said, it works for beginners, but once you are past that it only discourages people from trying.

Rank is a hard thing to handle in the wushu situation.  I have ranted in the past about why colored belts are bad and need to be done away with, instead opting for a system that doesn't have this strong stigma around it.  Wait.  I can't get into that again.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[One month to go.  Pressure is on.  I am training 7 days a week, normally for 2 or 3 hours.  I think things are paying off, but whenever I do a full set I am never happy with the results.  So many things I see that I need to work on.

Weekend was exhausting.  Friday was team training, then Sean and I hung out at my place and played rope dart while Kelly went with her Dad to see Riverdance.  She loved it.  I got rope burn on my ears.  Saturday we had testing at O-Mei, which by some horrible error on the part of the judges I get the same score as Debbie.  I tried to explain that to Debbie, but she insisted that I meant that her score was too high when I was trying to partake in self-demeaning banter. Perhaps she was trying to be counter-self-demeaning, or just hung up on the language barrier, but it wasn't working.

Saturday night the power was out at my place to Kelly, Sean and I went for a long walk.  It was odd to wander around my apartment complex and have everyone else outside wandering around because AC and TV were not working.  Some reason I was extremely hyper ' so much so that Sean thought I had taken 2 Entex.  I wanted to chase the fire engines, I hunkered like a monkey, did back flips and jump front kicks.  I was also up half the night because I couldn't keep my eyes closed.  I was only able to manage a couple-a-few hours of sleep that night.

Sunday, up at the butt-crack of dawn so I could drive up to the Maryland School for more team training.  It was good to train on the hard floor up there, but I was really feeling it in my legs. Not something I want to train on more than a couple more times before trials.  I didn't try tornado split on the floor, I didn't want to try on my own so I was waiting for Coach to make us do section one of cq.  But it never happened; my knee was pretty damn happy about that.  Stephan was able to break his spear in half, which ended up giving him a fat lip (I think), but really scared me because I thought it coulda hit his eye. Scary stuff.

Ran to church and showed up late (and sweaty), after the service headed out to Kai's house.  Kai, Jeannie, Danny, Guy and Gus dragged us up to Great Falls.  MD side. I was beat, and it was crazy hot.  Someone mentioned going to a swimming pool.  That sounded like a wonderful idea, but we never made it ' instead we went hiking and got lost in the woods.

Jeep's AC is broken.  I cannot remember the Chinese for 'Scale'.  Arg.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Not nearly enough time.

Sean has started up his Chinese class at NOVACC this week, I really wish I had the time to go.  I have a feeling that the class at NOVA is much better than the one at Chinese school.  Plus I am indecisive about weather to stick to traditional or just learn simplified characters.  I would prefer simplified since that is the mainland standard, and I am all about the standard there (despite mao taking the heart out of love).  Plus mainland is the place to go for wushu, and wushu is the driving force behind learning Chinese.  Of course training is what prevents me from learning language.  Aiya, more Chinese school zhongwen for me.

I skipped changquan class last night because Kelly needed a ride home from the office after dropping off the rental car.  She had to get a rental because I needed to take the jeep in for the AC service (which works now).  Part of skipping was me just being really tired, and the other part was me just wanting to see my wife.  We grabbed a nice dinner at Chili's and were able to be in bed before 10:30.

Hopefully tonight I won't be yawning all through class like I have done all week.

Tonight we are supposed to go hang out with Jeannie & Co - well I am going to class first, then try to catch up with them.  She is having a little "we ain't going to work tomorrow" party.  Then tomorrow, Kelly and I are going to have a BBQ and head into DC for some fireworks.  This code orange thing makes me a bit uneasy about going downtown, but I am not gonna let it stop me from taking my wife down there.  She really likes the DC 4th stuff.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Stinkin' Funny.

If you haven't seen wet hot american summer you really need to sit your self down and watch it.  No, it is not a porn. And you should not expect any serious film making, but it is stinkin' funny.  From the same people who made The State.  Crazy stinkin' funny.

We had a good 4th.  I trained on friday morning, which was up at the MD school.  I really hate having to drive that far, that early, for a floor that painful.  I know it is good to practice on the hard floor to get ready for the tournament, but it I really feel it in my shins after training there.  If I am ever responsible -- and in a place to do something about it -- I vow to make sure to get a foam spring floor for wushu training.  Despite all the things against it, training was really good.  It was also the last training I did for the weekend.  Taking Saturday and Sunday off was a good choice, IMO, I was able to have a good time hanging out with Kelly and our friends.

After friday training we had our 'lil BBQ,  I think we peaked at 11 people.  The core group was Jeannie, Danny, Sean and Chris 'n Kelly.  Some wushu people dissed us, some showed -- which was cool.  Kelly also was able to drag a few cap1 folks out.  Over all it was a success, and we had that amazing chocolate cake Kelly makes.  aaaahhhgghhggghhh.  Even the Jahova Witness girls that stopped by were pleasant and went away with minimal effort. Of course kelly did all the sending away, but it seamed easy enough.

We chased the BBQ with fireworks on the mall in downtown D.C. -- along with a million of our closest friends.  Wound up driving down there -- which I am fairly sure was the smart thing to do.  stumbled upon a parking spot around 9th and I, and were able to walk down to the 50 yard line of the mall.  Had a little picnic, kicked a soccer ball around, watched the aerial explosive show.  Came home and crashed.

Saturday we wound up going shopping.  Hit up target, and grabbed soem food at Red Robin.  Oh, on friday I had discovered I didn't have a frisbee of any sort, so I made everyone go to Galyan's so I could pick one up.  Also bought a little foam football.  Aerobie Rocketball I think.  Sean and I got tired of shopping so we went outside and threw our new toys around.  Eventually the rest of the party came out and we went to the Lay-z-boy store.  Not the most pleasant experience.  Kelly and I have been very serious about getting a new sofa so that we can retire her old futon from college.  Well, we began bartering with this sales lady -- only for me to walk away with a nasty used car shopping feeling.  We asked about one particular sofa, and wanted to know what she could do for us.  She said nothing.  Claimed that there was no room to come down any lower than the already rock bottom sale price.  We talked for a few more minutes and she was now giving us $50 off just for the hell of it.  So now we knew that she would lie to our face and be completely shameless.  I would rather pay an honest person more that deal with a person like that.  Least pay a person that can cover their lie better and come up with a reason why they can discount it a little for us.  We were fed up and headed off to go see "28 days later" -- which scared my wife, and thus didn't make me so happy to be sitting there watching it.  Honestly, it reminded me of a remake twilight zone episode where the producer got a little cared away.  Surprising we didn't see any giant spiders. The fiercest killer in the insect kingdom.

Today we slept in late.  Went back to the Lay-z-boy store and bought a nice sofa from a nice (read: different) sales lady who gave use a couple hundred off after we told her our story from yesterday.  We felt good, even after blowing an obscene amount for a sofa and getting the throw pillows too.  Yes, we bought the 5-year leather protection.  It was exactly what my wife wanted, and as a result I am happy.  Really strange how anyone can be that happy over a sofa that will arrive in 8-12 weeks.  It was like giving a 13-year-old a dirt bike.  Well maybe not, but I sure would like a dirt bike. Or a new G5.

We met up with Jeannie and Danny for some frisbee fun.  Don't worry, we cohersed Sean out there too.  After about 20-30 min of Ultimate we were dead.  So hot.  The pool was pretty hot too, but it felt great.  They talked me into bringing in my Aerobie Rocketball into the tool.  Well, by the end of the swimming session it was missing half it's fins. And I was just worried that it would get water logged.  Poor little football.  After drying off and heading back to Jeannie's place we got pizza and watched Wet Hot American Summer for the second time this weekend.  Stinkin' Funny.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Tornado split after tornado split.

Class last night was good, I especially like the end of class where we drilled jump front to tornado split.  Even with the nicer floor my heel was a bit sore and my hams a little shredded. This is the sorta thing I really need to drill to get ready for teams.  Hopefully tonight I will hammer on scale (in s.s.) for a while.  I also gotta decide if I am gonna go to gymnastics.  I probably will, I slept in late so staying up for a bit if flipping otta work out to my advantage.  Now, I wonder if Bryan is going.

<hr />

One thing at wushu I was noticing their lack of formality.  Or rather a thinly veiled attempt at forcing some sort of traditional 'martial' etiquette.  All the wushu places I have trained, be it in the US or china don't have that same feeling that I used to have growing up in TKD.  However, I don't think that the atmosphere at the training halls has changed.  Now when I go to a TKD school and I see all these old (often overweight) white guys forcing traditional Asian etiquette on their fellow students I cannot help but to think how trite and just plain silly it is.  Of course I think the structure is good, and I appreciate the higher set of manners.  It just seems that wushu has more of a sport mentality, along the lines of gymnastics or fencing ' not that the martial applications are gone, but rather the people who participate are able to see it for what it is.  Most of them at least, I find myself running into people who are convinced there is more to wushu.  That if they train in forms they can go kick someone's ass.

When I over hear that new kid talking about how they can now beat up any karate guy, or how much traditional kung fu sucks, or how silly TKD is -- well, I have that same reaction you get when you get cut off in traffic by some idiot that has no idea what the paint on the road is for.

Dammit, I have been thinking about this topic since last night, and I cannot put the words together right now.  Maybe I will come back to my discourse on <i>Fake etiquette/bad stereotypes and what I would do about it</i> later.  Zao gao le.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Ahhh, memories.

I stumbled across this as I was cleaning up my server and wanted to post it here for safekeeping.  Plenty of fond memories of the TKD club days.
<blockquote>
Hokido

Hokido translates to the Way of the Tiger Energy or the Way of the Tiger Spirit.  However if you pronounce it incorrectly is can easily be thought of as "The way of the Tiger Kids."  All these definitions are acceptable to the founders.  Unfortunately for the reputation of the art we are the founders.  Let me give you the story of how this art came about.

A group of Martial artists from Virginia Tech, all of whom had either black belts in Tae Kwon Do or the equivalent in a sister art, attended the VT Tae Kwon Do club.  This club took a trip down to a big tournament in Raleigh NC.  It was at this very tournament that we all attended a lecture from the granddaddy of Tae Kwon Do -- General Choi.  Choi went on to explain who he was and why he has sole rights to the Art of Tae Kwon Do.  He explained how he founded it and if you are not doing exactly what he is doing you are doing karate.  Someone even asked about Kungfu, he said that was karate.  At this point he went on to explain his new Sine wave theory and using arguments that are not founded by any mathematical or scientific means (we are all engineers, BTW).  Making all of his once adoring fans become confused and frustrated.  We were so excited that we were going to hear the founder of the art speak, only to be seared with his condescending sermon.  I am not trying to undermine this man, nor claim is art is poo, I am simply explaining the impression he had on us.  I am sorry if I have offended you.

At this point we knew if we did not abide by every thing he had said, that we would not be studying "Tae Kwon Do."  So we decided that we were now studying hokie-do.  (Virginia Tech Hokie's)  This was initially a joke.  We all laughed, but after time Gerald and I continued to claim to practice Hokie-do.  Starting with Our Tae Kwon Do knowledge we applied Jeet Kune Do concepts while force-feeding acrobatics into it.  Making Hokido a labeled version of everything we do.  Much like Bruce Lee invented Jeet Kune Do (please -- don't get me wrong, I am not comparing us to him, that would be an insult to him, rather I am giving credit for the borrowed ideas), and said that take what works for you, well we did.  But unlike Jeet Kune do, we are not purely concerned with fighting arts, Hokido also contains performing arts.  Acrobatics and Gymnastics are just as much a part of Hokido as sparring and ground fighting.

We speak lightly of the label "Hokido," but think of it as a goal for our personal refinement.

Wow, you made it this far -- I am impressed.
Chris.
</blockquote>
And I even stumbled across a couple of things that date back to freshman year.  I think I originally sent these out as emails, but they wound up on the original <i>The Fuzzymonks</i> webpage.
<blockquote>
I would like to clear something up.

Many people are confused over what a Ninja really is, and over what a Ninja must do. Ninjas don't just start out as a great master of deception, buy they must go through many hours of rigorous training and intense pain. For example: I learning to disappear (his s not just a little trick that can be learned over night) Ninjas will spend hours tying to disappear to no avail, and when they finally develop the skill, they are far from perfecting the "disappear." Quite often beginning ninjas will get big nasty blisters from the "little trick." So next time you are talking about the ninjas effortless ability to conquer all members of the animal kingdom, don't. Remember SANS (that is Secret Agent Ninja Spies) are hard working computer geeks who are bored
</blockquote>
And another!
<blockquote>
Well here I go again, caught up in that giant yo-yo that we call life. Most people complain that there yo-yo won't come back up, just sits there at the end of the string, spinning. Not me--nope, I am different--you will see. I, on the other hand, am that yo-yo that when you yo real hard and try to get that thing to sleep, but I come shooting right back up, and bruise your fingers. My life is an addictive little yo-yo, that will just keep shooting right back up into your hand, till you fingers hurt so much that you just have to switch hands. So as life goes on, and many people just yo, with out the other yo, I will be eating whipped cream and reading safety pamphlets.

I will leave you now, for I have wood to melt and a thesis to compose. This is where I leave the intellectuals that aren't.
</blockquote>
Reminds me of hanging out in the gym with Gerald to 2 a.m. desperately trying to teach ourselves capoeira and stressing about grades.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I took the jeep back to the dealer because the A/C has begun to not blow cold air anymore.  It was around the 1st of July when I took it in and they put dye in the system.  Well, they are gonna replace the evaporator coil -- which would normally cost upwards of $1100.  But the guy at Farrish said he call Chrysler and vouched that I take good care of my jeep, so now I only have to pay the $250 deductible and they will fix it for me.  If his story is legit (and I feel like it is) then all the trips to Farrish for routine maintenance have paid off.  Still is annoying, I sorta miss my old CJ7 because you would never worry about a silly little thing like A/C.  Or rain, or mud, or curbs.   I got the jeep back over lunch, and I will need to drop it back off Sunday night, hopefully I can get it Monday or Tuesday.

We had a crazy thunderstorm last night, I am glad I unplugged everything, including from the cable TV cable.  Kelly and I were lying in bed talking and the light just went out.  It uncanny timing, like it was almost convenient.  Good thing Kelly set the alarm on her phone.

Let me not forget my idee fixe:

Long weapon class was good.  I am pretty happy with the state of my staff form.  I still need to work on the end of section three.  That run-inside-kick-spin thing is still awkward.  We did 20 of those slam-three-swing things in section one and I have figured out how to go faster.  Part of it is just trying to go faster and paying attention to the steps I am taking so I keep the speed up, and the other part was simply choking up on the staff more.

More people are seeping out of the woodwork as we are getting closer to team trials -- we had a few people from KY in class.  They all seemed to be sporting daedal wushu.  Makes me wonder how many people will just appear form nowhere for the actual trials. I think the current estimates are between 40 and 60 peeps.

Ack!  Only two weeks left! Aiya.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Jamaican Jerk Salmon

Kelly makes an incredible bit of salmon on her lil grill.  Throw in some signature snow peas and Couscous and you have one impressive meal.  Not that I should be surprised when she makes a good meal, but this was crazy good. Crazy CRAZY good. criz-nazy.

Along the lines of kelly impressing me, I was showing her the full sets we taped during practice on Saturday and she ripped them up.  She really told me what sucked and what needed to be done.  Not that it was all bad, but she knows I don't need to hear that I stuck my butterfly front sweep -- but I do need to hear that I lacked power in section 4, or that I need to explode in my lotus.  best part of the evening was when kelly said that she needs to come watch me practice so she can help push me.  She also went on to say she was a little worried about lucas, that his wushu looked good -- and that maybe I should just go to china for 8 months and she would go live with Jeannie.

Kelly suggested that I go away from her for 8 months. If you know Kelly, that is impressive.

Of course I would simply take her with me.  I love that girl, she would do anything she could to help me.  That only drives me to take even better care of her.

Weekend was pretty good.  Cheryl was back in town and we were able to catch up with all our old Wushu friends.  Some of them we hadn't seen in a very long time. *cough*paulo*cough*  It was very nice to catch up with everyone.

I guess part of the niceness was that I could tell everyone that we happen to run into the USWA crowd at Peking Village when we went and grabbed some Zhong Guo Fan.  I recognized Li Ying there -- least I think it is her.  I also noticed Jian zen jiao and Ciu ya Hui (head coach of the BJ team) but I wasn't sure it was them until I checked with some people. Don't worry, I did exactly what the USWA coaches would have me do and ignored them completely.  It would have been nice to go up and give CYH a "Nin hao, remember me?" but that wasn't to be.  Plus, it's not like I would have gotten remembered for anything other than being that goofy white guy that came to Beijing in the winter. The hangin-out-with-good-old-friends was much better than the novelty of an awkward dinner anyway

I cannot decide if I should go see Charlie about my hip before trials.  I also have some strange bump on my wrist (I blames S.S.) and a ankle that is "not quite right" but not painful either. I am doing pretty damn good for training as much as I have been.

Less than 2 weeks to go.  11 days.  *shutters on the inside*

Did you know that [McLean Bible](http://www.google.com/url?sa=U&start=1&q=http://www.mcleanbible.org/&e=6251) puts their sermons up in MP3 format?  I think that is the best thing ever.  Now, if I could just get it to work on my Mac.  Neither Safari or IE both will display that page.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[3rd time is annoying

I have to take my Jeep back to the dealer for a 3rd time today because now that they fixed the AC my stereo doesn't work.  No power, no lights no nothing.  Agghhhhg.

And in addition to that (or maybe because of it) I had a really off day at wushu. Hurt my heal and knee (little annoying things), fell on my butterfly front sweep during full set.  And I had the flavor of unsalted saltines.  To top it all off my wife had to go to Richmond this morning.  Stupid Richmond taking my wife away.

Hungry now.  At least my wife made cookies for me last night and the one (and only) perk to her being out of town is there is no one at home to tell me to stop eating cookies.  An anti-perk is there will be no one to help me get more milk when I drink it all.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[My wushu 0wNz j00!

It looks like there are going to be [80 people](http://209.251.36.74/news/2003/news_07-15-03-b.htm) at team trials.  I keep having these pangs of doubt over my chances of hitting the top 12.  I know I will have another chance in 2 years -- even if I will be 27 then -- but something about it.  I know I am not gonna be embarrassed by my performance.  I can compete with the best in the country and not stick out like I don't belong, but I am worried I won't stick out as one of the good ones either.  But I cannot let this doubt play a part during team trials, I have to be mentally prepared for it, if I don't' believe that I own it my uncertainty will show through to the judges.  They will sense the fear like a big mean dog and the scores will rip me to shreds.

Plus I believe that the flavor and style doesn't come from correct technique but rather hamming it up and acting out the wushu how you think wushu ought to look.  Think of an old kung fu film and try to add some of that flair and style to the form.

Of course I don't want to become that guy with the big ego and no skills to back it up, but there is something to be said about that.  My Dad would always tell me that the fighter pilots needed their ego.  They needed to believe that they were better than everyone else in the world.  If they lacked this healthy self-view they wouldn't strap them selves into the jet and go up and have missiles shot at them.

So I need to refine my mental workout to get myself ready for competition.  I have done plenty of tournaments in the past, but this one has much higher stakes for me personally. I won't go around talking up my badass wushu skills; but when I get out on the carpet I will totally own it.  I have to or I will fail.

Thinking of this makes me nervous.

I am gonna go hide in a closet now.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Wushu was pretty good.  I hit tornado split a good 4/5 times -- that screwup I just landed with my back leg too bent. Overall I was pretty happy with it.  No full set today, which I was hoping for.  Coach lectured us about sleeping/eating/warming up good in preperation for the tournament.

Ja Kai has a new XL-1.  Camera lust.  But I think my wife might (someday) buy me a camera like that.  If you consider the GL series *like* that. And I do.

Droped the jeep off at the dealer <b>again</b>.  4th time this month.

I getta skip work and go to Kings Dominion tomorrow for a little team building fun time.  Yay!  So I am off to bed so i can get up early (why must forced-fun always start so crazy early?).  G'night.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Bowling as an after wushu hangout.</strong>

We decided to go bowling after wushu on Friday.  It is actually I really good idea for a post-wushu hangout.  Not that I am all for the game it self, but the situation is really cool.  You can hang out and are not forced into spending any money - just don't bowl.  No one sits around asking "what are we gonna do?"  And if you're bored you can always bowl.  Plus, everyone gets to wear cool shoes.  I am not a big fan of the lets turn the lights out, pump out smoke and play a strange mixture of Rock, Rap and Disco - I personally would like to hang out AND be able to have a casual conversation at a nice and easy volume level.  Eh, that's just because I am old and boring now, so I won't worry about it.

Next Friday, wanna go bowling?

<strong>3 full sets.</strong>

After a bizarre yoga-wushu workout on Friday (death by abs training) we had a serious all-full-set workout on Saturday.  Just a short warm up and we went at it.  Even drew straws to figure out the order.  Chang quan first, and then short weapon, long weapon.  It was pretty good.  I wanted to go my cq again because I thought I could do it better.  I was happy with my staff (however I wobbled TWICE: after the tornado and after the run-inside-kick).  Straight sword went well, I still need to relax.

Anita was running class and she went over what we need to work on and pointed out a few problems.  She told maybe half the class that we were ready and to only worry about the mental stuff.  It was reassuring to hear that form her, but still I feel like there are more technical details still haunting me.

I have a hard time getting mentally psyched up.  Part of me wants to just kinda give up and let it go.  I'd be so easy.  Just like what happened with Cirque.  But I decided a long time ago that I would push everything I had at this.  That I would live out that underdog-wins-the-tournament thing.  I will be danel-son. Aggh, I am gonna stop stressing about this for a while. Matthew 6:27.

<strong>Scariest thing in my life.</strong>

My wife driving.  Now, don't get me wrong, she is a very good driver.  But she insists on driving in the Washington DC Metro Area.  Where I happen to see nasty accidents every day.  It's just one of those nightmare situations where she could be headed home from work and never show.  Nothing I can do about it.  Lets just consider it a practice for trusting God to take care of her. You might also notice that her car has 8 airbags.  I guess when I don't have to worry about Anthrax, SARS, Planes dropping out of the sky and Snipers I worry about car accidents. Worry sucks. Matthew 6:27.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Whammie whammie whammie!

Have you seen that Arby's commercial where the Oven Mitt discovers he has no nose?  Well, ya'know how Mr. Mitt runs in a circle screaming after seeing his reflection in the toaster?  That's exactly what I do every time I realize how soon team trials are.  3 days. Not much to do now but walk through, get mentally prepared and rest.  Coach told us all to eat well, no parties, no movies and go to bed before 10pm.

The last two days I have felt void of flavor.  Coach says I shouldn't worry.  And I will blame Monday's lack of flair on the Wushu Whammie.

For those if you who aren't in the know:

Whammie.  <i>n</i>. WAM^-ee. Excessive and frequent evacuation of feces, usually indicating gastrointestinal distress or disorder.

One of those times you need a good magazine and at least an hour alone in the bathroom.  Preferably with a can of air freshener.   Wushu whammie is the worse of them all.

On that note ... Well, I donno'aiya]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Night before.

I am strangly calm, it's 11:30 and I am leaving for NOVA CC at 7:30 or so tomorrow so i am gonna jump in the shower and flop in bed momentarily.

The competitors meeting went well, better than I expected.  Sure the room we did the drawing in was small and hot, but that was only a minor detail. Got to see some old wushu friends -- people I had met in china -- overall it wasn't too stress full.

Oh, as it stands right now I go 16th of 30 in CQ, 9th of 12 in SS, and 3rd of 20 in staff.  Stupid 3rd -- and in my best event.  Overall I am pretty happy about those placements.

I am tired, it was a long day, nice...hot...shower...warm...bed.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Story of my life.

I missed the US team by LESS than a tenth of a point. Everyone said I did good, nearly everyone that I hadn't seen an a while (USWA peeps, and the fellas I met in china) said -- to quote Cameron -- "...have improved sooo much." Which was really cool to hear.  Unfortunately it was just not good enough to make it.

All right, enough pansy moping.  I sat on the gym floor looking sad for long enough last night.

I had a number of good accomplishments last night, not enough to prove my self to the wushu world.  I finished 4th in chang quan, and beat a number of <b>really</b> good players ' people that I had once considered untouchable.  My sword form, which is less than a year old, scored high (before my deduction on the salute for the last frikkin' movement), I think I was in the top 3 in that division. Not really sure, but I may have been the highest scoring white guy.  Crackers represent!

I may come back and write some more on the tournament it self later, depending partly on what goes up on Raffi's board -- I have a feeling I should just avoid it for a while.  Since I have gone to O-Mei for a year anything I say will be ripped apart.  If I say anything good about the tournament it will be blamed on the fact that I go to O-Mei, any thing negative will be considered with out any consideration for the good things I say.

Officially, I think the men who got on the A-team deserved it, they really did well.  And the judging, while inconsistent between divisions, was consistent with-in divisions.  When they were deducting they were deducting everyone in that division for the same little technical stuff. Then, it did seem that they didn't deduct much, if at all, for the southern stuff.

For the A team:
<ul>
<li>Jason: mei guo nan quan wang.  That guy seriously dominated southern, and the rest of the trials for that matter.  Jump inside fall was so high, he should have jumped over Big Kevin.</li>
<li>Justin: Mr Consistent and Technical. It paid off.  He nailed everything by the book, in fact the pictures in the book look like him, IMO.</li>
<li>Stephan: put on an awesome show, the crowd was behind him and he nailed everything.  He was <b>on</b> for chang quan and sword.</li>
<li>DY: I personally didn't know about him before, but he really had that flavor and style that you gotta respect.  Spicy.</li>
</ul>
More later, if I am unable to [not think about](http://www.globulos.com) it.

<hr />

<b>Added Aug 12th:</b>

I didn't want to post this on the front page, so I am going to put it up here, now that this post has slipped into the archives.  I keep having thought about making my blog password protected again - or at least require that you have an account on the PDP message board - but I don't know.  I like having people read my blog, it keeps me writing on a regular basis.  But then again I also would like to be able to write what ever I want about what ever topic I feel like.  When I first started this I was simply journal for me, and at the time I didn't think anyone would ever read it (it was in a  plain text file I stored on my harddrive), but it sorta evolved in to what you see.

Agghh.  No tangents, that's an entirely different topic for an entirely different time.

But please <b>don't read this</b> unless you are me, ok?  Thanks. Some things I just want to write so I don't forget them.

I wanted to write about my experiences at team trials, well - well mostly the mind games Christopher Pei tries to play.

Christopher Pei, here after CP, was all about the mind games.  It got started the night before the tournament, at the competitors meeting.  We made eye contact a number of times, refusing to acknowledge each other with anything more than a glare. I knew if I said "hi" he would not respond.  I also felt that if I did, that he would consider that a victory on his part.  So I stared back, refusing to break the stare first.  He would continue walking, looking smug, until we passed.  The most exciting part of that night (in relation to CP) was when I was coming back into the hotel to seek Kelly and He and Tom were leaving.  Nothing was said at all, just a glare - but once CP and I passed, Tom and I waved good-bye, smiled and gestured at each other.  It stuck me pretty heavy - we both knew how to act and what to do, despite that very strange and potentially dangerous situation.

Things only got exaggerated the day of the competition.  I few time early on, I would look over to CP and notice he was looking at me, he would not glance away, but rather slowly and casually direct his attention elsewhere.  At first I thought I was being paranoid until CP was walking through a crowed lobby and made his way right past me.  He went by close, there was probably a 6 to 8 ft clearing next to me and when he passed by I could have elbowed him with out moving. That too could have been coincidence, except he was staring me in the eye the entire time.   This sorta thing continued for a while.  Other people were noticing that they were being pointed out to ZGF by CP, people they didn't know about.  Everyone noticed how strange things seemed.  J pointed out he was old hat at this, and they do it every chance they get.

I will say this, when I saw ZGF, we said Hello.  It was polite, not comfortable, but there was no hostility.  Unlike when CP looks though me, it's like pangs of hostility. I honestly believe that she is a good person, simply emotional.  I totally respect that, and have found myself defending her to a number of people that would normally write her off as crazy.  It's just emotions, when she calms down she is very reasonable.

Anyway, things with CP didn't change much.  He would keep walking by.  I kept refusing to let him win.  Eventually I needed to get rid of some of the stress so I started playing my own games.  Nothing serious, mostly it was to set the situation so that it would be a big joke in my head.  This was simply so that I could classify CP as a silly guy and concentrate on the competition.

So, when he walked by mean again I would bounce along next to him as he walked, or make poot noises once he rounded a corner.  Well, I think those were the only two things I did, but I felt better.  Juvenile, but maybe I was just bouncing in that direction anyway.  I thought it was pretty harmless.

The shining moment of interacting with the coaches was when ZGF was talking to Kelly and invited us both back to USWA.  She said something along the lines of if we said we were sorry we can always come back.  This was huge, monumental.  I had a very in-depth knowledge of how the circle works, an no one could ever leave the circle and come back.  Unless'.UNLESS, you were good, like a certain girl I know.  By inviting me back, I think ZGF was telling me that I had gotten good.  Or at least that I could be really good.  I was flattered.  Once I got over that, I was amused at the idea.  Then, once that wore off I missed Peter.  I think he may be married now. I would have gotten him a textured shirt.  We were textured friends.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I found this out on Xanga:<blockquote>DY got third in Long First, i believe, I don't think Christ from Omei got third.   I'm pretty sure Chris didn't get third.  </blockquote>
Thanks for the vote of confidence.  I really have something to prove still.  I feel like no matter what I do I will be plagued by the "goofy white guy" deduction.  Im not talkign about the judges, I mean the US wushu community.

Fair or unfair, no one should stoop to unsportsman like conduct.  O-Mei bashing is in full effect, which really makes me sad.  I know everyone says they are not attacking the competitors, but the administration, but I personally feel attacked.  Not just for me, but for my friends too.  But like I said, nothing I can say about it that will have any effect, save for bad effect.

Considering going to Pittsburgh in 2 weeks, haveta decide soon if I want to go.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[My apologies to the nice, and well intending guy that made the comment I quoted in the last entry ' I read into it too much and I must admit I was looking for negative, so I found negative.  Sorry man.

You know that means I am guilty of the exact same thing that I am bitter about from the rest of the US Wushu community -- every one seemed the expect biased judging, so not matter what the judges did everyone thought 'Ah-ha! Look! Biasedness!'  I heard everything.  One group of people said they hated White people.  Another said it was west coast.  I even talked about how they preferred nanquan to taiji and changquan.  Looking back on it I don't know if I could actually give out different scores.  I mean I wanted my friends to score higher, so I could say that so-n-so should get a few more tenths, but that would be just fooling my self.  Of course I expect them to do better, but then I am biased.  It's just that everyone is biased, and unless there is some solid concrete proof otherwise it is impossible to be honestly objective.

Judging is pretty much a moot point, and I think that most people will decide that it was not full out 'rigged.'  Least that is what I am going to tell myself.  And as I person who didn't make it, I would much rather blame it on the white boy deduction.

I feel really bad for my coach.  I used to be one of those who thought she was so corrupt and scheming, and now I feel horrible that I ever thought bad things of her.  Now I see her on a daily basis and have gotten involved in helping out I see how hard Lu Xiao Lin tries, and how good her intentions are.  She is purposefully avoiding any political debate, and people who oppose her try to claim that she is hiding ' which seems to imply her guilt.  I know most of her students purposefully avoid any online wushu politics ' she gets left out to dry.  This is really sad.

Just one little example of this, O-Mei wasn't supposed to run the trials at all.  They were planning on doing the USAWKF Nationals.  AFAICT, they changed the date because it conflicted with a number of college finals for the competitors.  If this is the case, she had the choice of holding the trials at her tournament or screwing over a number of good non-O-Mei students (I don't think any O-Mei student had a conflict with the original dates).  But now, she is opened up to those exact same students bashing her for looking like she has too much power and influence.  It is sad.

Hmmm, is LXL Wushu's Bella Karoli?  I wonder if people know that he has final say and can pick and choose the team, despite the competition scores.  Wouldn't that be fun in the wushu world?
<hr />
More a personal note, but still on the topic of wushu.  Kelly is really getting into this; I think she has gotten to the point where she really wants to come practice again. Plus she has been sitting and reading all the mud slinging that has been going on.  (This is good and bad, but I am happy to have someone that I can talk to)]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Work moved us out of the nice happy conference room into a couple co cubes and a closet.  Everyone (except for us) were acting like it was a good, thing.  "Don't worry you'll be out of the conference room soon" they would say, bah. I wanna go back.  I am all isolated and it is depressing out here.

I am pretty depressed about wushu right now.  It seems like everyone that tried made it.  I try to make myself feel better by learning new stuff, like, say...spear.  But sitting in a frikking cube annoyed that I am being bathed in nasty green florescent light isn't helping my pity-party.

I feel bad for Kelly.  I have poured so much time into my sport and she is always the one that gets shafted by it.  Oh, she knows it too, most of the time she pushes me to train - but every so often has to put her foot down.  And the downing of the foot hasn't happened in a very long time.  I think she needs more [nice things](http://www.tiffany.com/)

Avoiding a life of mediocrity is hard to do.  Especially if you follow all the rules and do what you are <i>supposed</i> to do.

I am going to Richmond tomorrow, so I will get ot meet Joshua for the first time.  Plus I will get to go play with Jacob, which is clearly the most exciting thing ever. We can go outside and <i>chris</i>.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<b>Fun with tornados:</b> My first muddy steps into Bagua

Friday i took my first bagua class, it is part of the wushu indulgence I am allowing for my self now that team trials is over.  I was a good class, mostly due to the skilled guidance of Johnson (one of the internal coaches at O-Mei, and no, I don't know if that is his first or last name).  Allow me to paraphrase one of the tidbits of knowledge Johnson bestowed upon our class:

xingyi takes 10 years, taiji takes 20, but bagua will never be mastered

He said it in much more elegant terms, but that is the gist.  Kelly pointed out that maybe bagua is not for me because I want to master everything I do.  Of course I won't do it unless it is impossible to master.  Then I don't feel so bad about not mastering it.

<b>JACOB! and Joshua too.</b>

it was awesome to see Jacob, Laura tells me he has been asking about me and was all excited that Kelly and I were coming down.  He showed me <i>chris moves</i> -- he even as a great one where he jumps up and spins a full 360 and lands flat on his belly.  That was great until he busted his lip on the ground.  I do need to make him some moves that don't involve me hitting people, 'cause I am the root of his violent streak (aiya!)

<b>HELLO?!?</b>

Friday night my cell phone wet off -- the caller Id said ti was everett.  I though "this is odd, how did he know I was in town." When I picked up it seemed like he had a bad signal and was breaking up.  So I stood outside yelling "Hello!" for 10 min.  Apparently, he didn't call me, instead his ever-so-intelligent phone did it for him (how his phone knew I was in town I will never know), but as we was driving down the highway in a mini-van loaded with toys he heard me yelling "HELLO" at him -- eventually our persistence paid off and we were able to set up a rendezvous for the next night.

Everett, well, what can I say, he looked like he was doing good.  There is more of him now -- and he made new music, which I really didn't get to listen to, but I want to.  Needa get a copy.  I am glad that his cell phone called me.

I am also glad that he introduced me to [Strong Bad](http://www.homestarrunner.com/sbemail.html) and his [friends](http://www.homestarrunner.com/).]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Yesterday I really had the hankering to go to gymnastics and wushu - I think I can blame that on watching a few of [Team Ryouko](http://www.teamryouko.com/)'s  [videos](http://www.teamryouko.com/newvids.shtml).  Good stuff - I love the 5 step wall flip. And I want springy shoes more than, say, a G5.  But not as much as I want a pit and a few mats.

But the real true highlight of yesterday was the whole anniversary thing.  A whopping 3 years of marriedness.  Kelly had a pretty crappy day at the office, but I was able to pry her out of there shortly after five (at one time she was saying she <i>might</i> be done by 7:30) and we went to see American Wedding. Which I thought was crazy funny.  Much better than last the anniversary when we saw Austin Powers 3.  We chased that with a little dinner at the Daily Grill.  Not our best seats (it was like the wheel seat on the bus) or our best waiter (he was clearly involved in much more witty banter with the other patrons) - but it was good food, and the manager that ran around in a nice suit checking on people was extra attentive to us.

No more details for you!  Ha!

Oh, but I did find a great [article on care sales](http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2003/8/4/163150/0581)]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<b>Kelly's nocturnal self-defense</b>

After last night I don't worry about strange men sneaking in to my house and snuggling with my wife any more. I have found that she has a built in self defense mechanism ' the head butt.  I tell you something, I was just scooting close to get some warmth and WHAM she jerked her head back and knocked me right on the top of the head. The pain was so great that I no longer feel a need to worry about her getting mis-snuggled

<b>Psst, I got a id'e fixe</b>

I didn't make it to gymnastics last night, wushu ran late and I wasn't feeling all the great.  I did however do a little tumbling at wushu.  Make sure I can still do my cheesy basic tumbling pass and did a few tucks.  It was nice to practice twists and flips again after concentrating on compulsory and nothing but compulsory movements for so long.

My butterfly twist feels low again. I will have to get that back up.  And now that I have proven to my self that I can do a tornado split I otta get that twist split thing up to par.  Once my hamstrings feel better.  They have been toasted since the Monday after trials.  Or maybe it was at trials, but I was too tired afterwards to notice.

Tuesday, I swear, on Tuesday I will go back to the gym.

Spear was fun though.  I do like half the first section now, but I even had one of the little kids say that he thought I was good a spear.  And apparently there was some debate over weather or not I have been doing spear or not.  Either they are the most unobservant kids ever or I didn't suck like I thought I did.  I'll interpolate and pretend that I am somewhere in the middle.  I wanna do more, but today I getta play bagua, assuming we can get a coach for the class.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<b>Lunch #3, Monkey name Chris, 13th</b>

I have already eaten my lunch and I am still hungry.  I didn't even wait for lunchtime.  I donno if I am gonna just be hungry or go get some more food.  See, I have this problem when I get home I needa eat before wushu, but that doesn't give me more than an hour to get food and eat it.  So I wind up going to wushu just after eating.  Not happy times.  But it is also anti-happy when I am all shaky and shivery because I didn't eat. I need to move my eating times away from the traditional meal schedule.  I am thinking 10:30 for lunch #1 (I guess this could be breakfast, but I don't ever eat breakfast so I'll call it lunch), cause I am always hungry by then.  Then lunch #2 at 2:30 or 3.  And a post wushu dinner around 10.  That sounds more pleasant.  Maybe I will rename dinner to lunch #3, because that is way funner.  Heh. Funner. [Funnerlishious!](http://www.homestarrunner.com/sbemail68.html)

This weekend was a lot of fun.

We had a BBQ and forced a bunch of O-Mei people to come eat red meat (now, if we could only inter-mix our wushu friends), which was a success.  Except for Amina, who ate a veggie burger.  But we don't talk about that.  We hung out and played some games watched some wushu and learned the secrets of the shao lin.  In the process I got a monkey named after me.  So if you ever go to Brazil, make sure you find Paula and meet her monkey named "Chris."  Great stuff.

Friday I went to bagua, but we didn't have a bagua coach so George took over and taught us a few new palms.  Now I know 1-7!  Only one more to go, then I have to worry about "perfecting" them.  Yay - modified dragon style. Saturday we did a lot of sub-sub-section drills.  Short little bits of the form -- more than a combo, but not quite half a section -- didn't get to spear, but s.s. needs work anyway.

<hr />

Well, we did the math - I missed the US team by one hundredth of a point.  I finished 13th.  My goal was top twelve.  That was disappointing, but somewhat reassuring -- for some reason it makes me feel as if I am more accomplished than when swimply I didn't make the team.  Still, it's not enough.  I am not gonna settle.  Must train harder. Mmmm, bitter.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I will go to gymnastics tonight.  No matter what.  I am going to have to tell coach that I must leave by 8:30 so I can make sure I will be there.  Must encourage this urge I am having to go back and get better at some non-wushu acrobatics stuff.  For example, I really want to do wall flips again, but I have been scared to try them outside of gymnastics.  But at gymnastics we don't' have any walls to flip on.  I think this is half the reason I miss VT Gymnastics, wall flips. Maybe Carlos will let me try on that pole at the edge of the floor.

I got to teach last night, it was really fun, I wish I could have done a better job though.  I really like to run class - this urge to help people get better. I felt kinda bad when I decided to do throw-n-roll drills, one of the students thought it was stupid and went and practiced out off the floor in protest.  I understood, but I also thought it was good that we practice them.

A couple of times X chimed in and tried to help, but mostly I wanted to have the class succeed or fail because of me.  But I couldn't say anything because I didn't know that the class was <i>mine</i> until it was almost over.  Originally I was supposed to warm us up, and wound up running the entire thing.  Which I was glad to do, and I checked and double-checked with the guy who would have been in charge by default and he was (repeatedly) cool with it.  So, with hindsight, it was my class.

There have been a few people that have had this amazing skill for running a good class, I want to learn this.  Sure LXL or ZGF had a well established structure, but Brandon and Master Phuong could run a class with a perfect balance of fun and serious work.

Bla? Baba-bla.

I know when I hear people talk about Anita's class they all say that she demands perfection - I think they mean it in a bad way - but I hear this and think that I want them to say the same of me.

Yep.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I totally bashed my knee during spear last night.  I remember doing it, but I don't remember when.  Spear is hard, I was dead tired and wanted to go throw up -- and I am just learning it.

I heard Jason <i>jia you</i> for me a few times last night, somehow he manages to convince me that he really means it.  If I hear most people cheer me on I just think they are being nice, but that kid has me convinced he means it.  I mostly point this out, because I want to know what it takes to get that guy to other people.  The only thing I can think of is only <i>jia you</i> when you mean it -- but there has to be more to it than that.

I took Sean and Neal to the gym last night.  Paula was gonna go, but she bashed her knee during spear (I can relate).  I harassed them and got Carlos to come help teach and spot back tucks.  I think if Sean tried he would have it, no problem.  He is much better than I when I started out.  Must be all the wushu. He was also landing butterfly twists on an 8" mat in the pit.  I was impressed.  Neal made it around on a few back tucks, and was doing double legs over the (maybe 3' 6" high) rope with me.  Double legs are fun.  I tumbled a little, but my feet still hurt - ever since team trials.  Like just inside the arch next to the ball of my left foot, it's like the bones hurt.  Maybe they are just bruised.  It hurts to walk with out shoes on.

Today we are going to the NC, see [Brandon](http://ncschmoo.livejournal.com/) and Gerald (and meet his woman, hopefully).  Sean is bumming a ride - but will be staying with his bike shop friends.  Jeannie is tagging along so it should make for a fun trip down.  Unfortunately  I think <b>I</b> will be doing all the driving. Yay, Raleigh!]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[You know that demo I was supposed to do this past Saturday?  Well, it looks like I missed an [exciting](http://im1.shutterfly.com/procserv/47b3d636b3127cce8c9b843ea7c90000001610) [time](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A4072-2003Aug16.html). Not that our weekend wasn't exciting, but that was crazy.

Well, Raleigh was fun.  Probably the most notable thing was we got to meet Chas for the first time.  She seemed really cool, we didn't have much time to hang out - but she definitely seems to be good for G.  I mostly say this because I saw her round kick him to the head.  As strange as it is to see G with a woman, I am really happy for them.  (pssstt!  I saw G put his arm around her while sitting in a theater!  How about that for PDA!  Hah!)

We had a full car for the drive, and that seemed to help the trip.  It was pretty rare for the conversation to die completely.  Often there were more than one going on at a time.  We kept Sean around at Brandon's for the night, subjected him to <i>How to loose a guy in 10 days</i> -- but I think he was tired because he didn't have any entertaining commentary.  Saturday we unloaded him at the bike shop and did a little IMAX thing, ate food and wound up at B's house again.  Apparently some people don't think sitting in the living room with a giant projected computer screen watching random videos from the web to be a <i>totally awesome</i> evening, so we went out to play a little pool.  Not exactly the "clubbing" thing I think the women had planned, but it pretty dang fun.  Not crowded or smoky or loud at all.  I was very happy. And as far as I could tell, so was everyone else.

I finished <i>Ender's Game</i>, really fast for me, I read it in less than a week.  Now I want to get the next book - there is a nice little quartet in the ender series.  It was not real deep reading, like Heinlein want to be, but I think Card made me think more.  It gave me weird dreams.  I could relate to Ender - and as a result everything seemed strangly real.

I think I am gonna skip wushu tonight and hang out with just Kelly, despite being around her all weekend, I haven't had much of a chance to interact with just her.  We had lots of people consuming our attention, which was a good thing, but I like my wife.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Sorry to do this AGAIN, but I am just throwing this in here for safe keeping.  If you read Raffi's board you have already read this. If not, then it's long and boring and prolly of very little interest.

I had a little thread on Raffi's board with Javonne -- I wanted to save it for posterity sake.  Plus when it got the point that he was calling me a clown I felt that replying on the board wasn't gonna do me any good.  Because we all know that the one thing wushu needs it to have money thrown at it.  Any can survive with proper marketing and lots of money behind it.  Like the XFL.  Not that I am still hung up on it, so I will just cut-n-paste for now. If you want to add something to this, [by all means](http://boards.gamers.com/messages/message_view.asp?name=raffi&id=zxyxm).

    TALK IS CHEAP.
    THOSE THAT ARE IN CONTROL ARE LAUGHING BEHIND CLOSED DOORS.

    They say...
    what can they do? Nothing... just go to the events spends their money, take the silly little FAKE gold, silver and bronze medal and go home.

    MEANWHILE: Their making money, building THERE names AND GIVE NOTHING BACK.

    THE GAME ISN'T ABOUT "THE COMPETITION" ANYMORE IT ABOUT ... THE ~~~> M O N E Y!!!!"

    THOSE THAT HAVE IT (AND SHARE IT) ARE SUCCESSFUL AND THOSE THAT DON'T ARE NOTHING BUT A FART IN A WINDSTORM.

    LET'S LOOK AT A COMPETITION....

    200-300 (IF THEIR LUCKY) ATHLETES AT $60.00 - $100.00 DOLLARS PER PERSON.

    Gross ~$18,000 - $30,000

    1. Hotel
    2. Event ~ arena ect.
    3. Teachers, coaches, judging expense.

(This is the only sport where the judges, teachers and coaches make more money than the athletes!!!)

    4. RARE BUT IT HAPPENS ~~~~~>Elite athlete expense (travel /sometime hotel expenses)
    5. Transportation expense (Wushu carpet, Ring materials ~ tape, Teitai platform, and paper work ect. & MASTERS FROM AIRPORT ECT.)
    6. Clean up expense
    7. Competition dinner and awards
    8. Employee expense (Those that collect money and see to a smooth competition. "let's call this the people behind the scene."
    I know theirs more...beacuse their not giving it to the athletes!!!!lol

    ANY-WAY>>>!! After it is all said and done, they come out with a few grand to pay bills.

    THIS IS WHAT PROMOTERS WINE ABOUT... AND TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH........... IT MAKES ME SICK!!

    THE FUNNY THING IS THEIR HAPPY MAKING THE CHUMP CHANGE ...AND THEY WON'T DO ANYTHING TO IMPROVE THIS "SAD" SITUATION. YEAR AFTER YEAR, IT'S THE SAME O'L THING. WINE, WINE WINE, BLA BLA, BLA,.........AND STILL No meetings, no news letters, NO NATIONAL PROMOTION...no unity...no nothing!

    Change isn't given...PEOPLE TAKE IT!

    IT'S THE AMERICAN WAY...

    PREPARE FOR 2004 WUSHU COMPETITION SEASON.

    TALK TO YOUR FELLOW STUDENTS ~ AND OPEN THIER EYES !!
    TALK TO FUTURE MARTIAL ATHLETES AND OPEN THEIR EYES !!
    TALK TO YOUR TEACHERS ~ OPEN THEIR EYES!!
    TALK TO YOUR COACHES ~ OPEN THEIR EYES !!

    GET ON THE PHONE AND...!!!

    TALK TO YOUR PARENTS ~ OPEN THEIR EYES !!
    TALK TO YOUR LOCAL UNIVERSITIES ~ GET THEIR OPINION.
    TALK TO YOUR LOCAL HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVIST GROUP ~ GET THEIR ADVICE.

    RECORD EVERYTHING YOU HEAR, YOU SAY, AND YOU DO!!

    TRAIN AS HARD AS YOU CAN...BEACUSE ONLY THE BEST (ALL AROUND WUSHU/ SANSHOU / TAIJI / TRADITIONAL SYSTEMS..ECT.....HAVE THE LOUDEST AND STRONGEST VOICES.)

    AND MOST OF ALL...
    DON'T BARK AT THOSE IN POWER. (WITH EYES WIDE SHUT ~ They have set their course.)

    IT IS UP TO US TO TAKE THIS SPORT TO THE NEXT LEVEL AS WE LEARN FROM THERE MISTAKES.

    Remember: power isn't given ... you take it!

    Hey, it's the American way!

    Continued from: http://boards.gamers.com/messages/message_view.asp?name=raffi&id=zxzeg

-Here's two.....
-1. NASKA (north american sport karate association)
-2. NBL (national black belt league)

    Huh? Your saying an athlete gets paid more in NASKA than a coach does? Even the best sponsored teams (say, TPM) only get their tournament fees and travel covered. The only money they pocket is if they win a grands at some big 5 star tournament.

    But it would appear from the message that you are talking in the context of the tournament only. So I'll ignore that sponsorships stuff aforementioned, and only think about that the tournament organizers pay for.

    I think tournaments should pay the Judges (not coaches, not teaches) to provide their service -- which tends to not happen in NASKA, and results in the quality judging they paid for. The I personally think the athletes should not be paid, and the same for their coaches/teachers.

    I see the NASKA and NBL tournaments as much bigger waist of time and money than any of the Chinese Martial Art events I have competed it. I am sure there are bad ones too, but I definitely see sport karate events are ripping more people off.

    Also, being a person who has organized a tournament I understand how easy it is to loose money on it, much less break even or make a profit. Unless you have the resources of a university (which I did when I organized the tournament) I see a huge potential for loss. I just can't see the tournament gig as a great way to make money, but more a big financial risk and one bad even could ruin the promoters (assuming they are a nice little mom-n-pop martial arts school) -- otherwise, why don't we throw together a few big tournaments and get the money we need to promote our sport proper.

-IT IS UP TO US TO TAKE THIS SPORT TO THE NEXT
-LEVEL AS WE LEARN FROM THERE MISTAKES

    Yes'yes we should =)

    Lets figure out how to do these things right, and do them. But there is nothing good in ignoring the reality about the finances. Then again some wushu school are going inexplicably well and the owners are rewarded with, say, an s600.</blockquote>

~~~~~~~~> Correct. Chinese/wushu competition promoters pay judges and coaches (that judge) cold hard cash. While the athletes get a pat on the back and a silly little medal.

    THINK ABOUT IT. THEY HAVE MONEY TO GIVE TO THESE JUDGES. Come-on..., THEY THOUGHT ABOUT IT, SET this ca$h ASIDE, AND THEN GAVE IT TO THEM ON THE SLIDE. And to tell you the truth, it sucks!

    THINK ABOUT IT....

    Correct.

~~~~~> Hey, only the best come out for the cash. If you want to make money; you need to fill the stands. You want to fill the stands;you need to give them something to see. They don't want to see judges THEY WANT THE BEST...AND THE BEST WANT CASH.

- waist of time and money than any of the Chinese
- Martial Art events I have competed it. I am sure
- there are bad ones too, but I definitely see sport
- karate events are ripping more people off.

    oH YES, but then-again...look at the quality of the athletes in a NASKA event and then, look at the quality of the athlete at a Wushu competition. NASKA blows them away... and this is all due to the money. NASKA and NBL hell... their smart, build, promote, sell, and pay champions.

- Also, being a person who has organized a tournament

    Wushu Union partially reimburses judges for their travel and lodging expenses. That's it.

    In the future, we'd like to give more prizes that the two $500 grand champs. But you can't have a competition at all if you don't have any judges.

    Don't you think we can find a balance between compensation of event officials and prizes for comeptitors? I'm not saying it should be even, but you need to have both of them or you're not going to have a competition at all.

    Yes, you've assisted athletes with prize money. That's nice. Not a good or great thing...just nice. If you really love the sport next year you'll give out a $1000.00 and have more than one competition. NO, IF, AND's...OR BUT's about it ...simply'JUST DO IT!

    THERE ARE MANY WAYS TO GET $3000.00 - $6000.00 IF YOU PLAN "TODAY" not TOMMORROW, or A FEW MONTHS BEFORE THE COMPETITION... COME ON NOW...WE KNOW HOW IT WORKS.... BUSINESS IS BUSINESS. THOSE THAT PLAN AHEAD AND WORD AT IT DAILY, GET AHEAD (AT THIS STAGE IN THE GAME) AND THOSE THAT DON'T SAY THINGS LIKE.... IF...and... WE LIKE TO...OR...SHOULD.

    And by the way...A PROMOTER CAN 'CREATE' JUDGES.... we all know that... BUT YOU CAN'T CREATE/DRAW THE COMPEDITORS YOU NEED TO MAKE YOUR COMPETITIONS A GRAND EXPERIENCE FOR EVERYONE.

- Don't you think we can find a balance between
- compensation of event officials and prizes for
- competitors?

    YEeeS... YOU CAN! BUT YOU... WON'T or shall I say YOU DON'T. 'OR MAYBE YOU CAN'T'Just a thought'''''''.

    I'm not saying it should be even, but
- you need to have both of them or you're not going to
- have a competition at all.

    YOUR MAKING THINGS HARD FOR YOURSELVES, IT TAKES TWO YEARS (TWO COMPETITION SEASONS) TO PRODUCE THE EFFECTS YOU NEED TO MAKE EVERYONE HAPPY.

    1ST ~ YOU MUST "CREATE" A 5 YEAR PLAN AND STICK TO IT.
    2ND ~ YOU MUST "EXSPAND" YOUR TARGET AUDIENCE.
    3RD ~ YOU MUST "GIVE" THOSE THAT ATTEND YOUR EVENT A REMEMBERABLE EXPERIENCE.
    4TH ~ YOU MUST "LOCATE" AND "PROMOTE" YOUR BEST ATHLETES, NOT THE ONES YOU LIKE.
    5TH ~ YOU MUST "REACH-OUT" AND "INFORM" YOUR COMMUNITY (TARGET AUDIENCE/ GENERAL PUBLIC) ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THEIR TOWN/CITY MARTIALALLY.

    I have many great tools that you can use to assist you in this endeavor. MOST OF THEM I'VE LEARNED FROM MARTIAL ORGANIZATIONS LIKE:

    KRANE ~ A New England based martial art competition promoters > the true founders of NASKA.
    PKL ~ The Professional Karate League which was founded by a Chinese martial artist.
    NASKA ~ Well we all know them and their success!
    NLB ~ The National Black Belt League.
    USWKF ~ and our own...United States Wushu Kungfu Federation.

    BUT MOST OF ALL , I THINK IT'S MY 12 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE AS A GROUP AND PERSONAL TRAINIER, WITHIN THE HEALTH AND FITNESS INDUSTRY; ATTENDING SEASONAL FITNESS TESTINGS, WORKSHOPS, CONFERENCES; MISS FITNESS, BODY BUILDING COMPETITIONS, GYMNASITCAND YOUTH ATHLETIC EVENTS THAT HAS EHANCED MY PERCEPTION, MY VISION, MY VIEW''

sheer number of competitors is the difference in being able to pay competitors and judges alike (as well as make money for the promotor). at the current time, even in the best of situations, wushu doesn't have the raw numbers that naska and nbl competitions do.</blockquote><blockquote><b>If you love NASKA so much why don't you marry her???

    It is a her, isn't it?

yeah, i'd be great if we could fill the stands and make wushu a spectator sport, but I don't see that happening unless we first get to the level that, say, gymnastics has. And they are a FAR cry from a spectator sport. But the do have world wide acceptance and a strong following (of fanatical parents, with delusions of olympic greatness)

But there are not professional gymnasts (like there ice skaters), those people tend to move onto other performing arts -- which in a sense is the natural progression of their career. Or, coaching -- which is a given. Very similar to how a wushu career could progress.

I don't think wushu will ever get mainstream acceptance here, especially if you consider that in china, Where they have the talent and the funding (and well organized tournaments), but you ask anyone on the street their favorite wushu athlete and they say Jet Li or they change the subject to Yao Ming.

How else are the stands gonna get filled up? Maybe mainstream acceptance is a lofty goal, but we need a niche greater than our parents and friends to come out and cheer.

Even that acceptance isn't gonna be had by throwing money at it. Nor is bribing the best to come show off. Especially in the long term. If we want to promote wushu the effective way is to get people (well, kids) into it. Start 'em off young, I loved the idea of the summer camp -- now lets breed a new generation of coaches and who can organize proper and do things right. (props for Jeff and Co. for helping that thing out, BTW)

Hrmmm, maybe we need some bboy-style wushu battles. just compete for respect! =)

    Let me ask you,

    How many ADVERTIZING/PUBLIC RELATIONS are sitting in a college Wushu competition stands?

    How many of them are sitting in a national Wushu competition stands?

    How many Wushu competitors PARENTS and/OR FRIENDS ARE RELATED OR MARRIED TOO OR KNOW SOMEONE IN ADVERTIZING/PUBLIC RELATIONS OR ANY FIELD THAT AN ASSIST THEIR CHILD IN EXPERIENCING THE BEST OUR SPORT CAN OFFER?

"YOU" DON'T know because PROMOTERS DON'T FOCUS ON PARENTS, SPECTATORS, OR FRIENDS THAT COME OUT TOO CHEER for their child or their friend.

- Even that acceptance isn't gonna be had by throwing

~~~~~~>Yes it will! HAVE YOU EVER MISSED A COMPETITION BECAUSE YOU COULDN'T AFFORD IT!!
    Money will give students and low-income families the opportunity TO EXPERIENCE MORE.
    Money will give that struggling world-class athlete an opportunity to participate in something they LOVE! Money will motivate top athletes to train harder and most of all ATTEND every national competition.

    AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST...
    WHEN A KID, RETURNS HOME AFTER COMPETITION

    THEIR FRIENDS ASK THEM IF THEY WON

    THEN THEY ASK, "WHAT DID YOU WIN?"

    In a world where money talks and bullshit walks (...and kids know this) Do you really think we can hold his or her attention after 3 years of the same ol boring, silly little piece of fake gold, silver, or bronze metal. This teaches children that if you work hard in the real world you'll get a cheap reward.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I found out that some people I used to be friends with are now on the other side of the country for a wedding.  I used to call the groom my best friend.  He said it didn't matter what happened we would be friends.  I really did try.  I am despondent now.  Sorry, I needed to be cryptic, I think. Maybe.

Friendships used to seem like such a permanent thing to me.  And I don't know why, I grew up an Air Force brat, every 4 or 5 years we would up and move.  Most places we lived I can remember having friends that I swear we wouldn't loose contact with, but always did.  Maybe they feel permanent because the friendship was always ended because of outside forces, because my parents <b>made</b> me move.  But now it seems like people get mad and that leads to gossip and the produces bickering and other strife.  Once things start going downhill it's a free for all, faction's form, people choose sides and we cozen away.  It's all that part of human nature that ruins politics and allows for reality TV and soap operas.  I wish there was a way to kick that-part-of-human-nature's ass.  Cause I'd tell some people all the bad things it has done and we'd all get pissed off and gather up some people to beat it up.

Took the day off from wushu yesterday, but Kelly did take me to see <i>Pirates of the Caribbean</i>, which I enjoyed immensely.  It was much better than I expected, and that in and of it self makes for a good movie.

Anyone got a copy of <i>Speaker of the dead</i> they wanna give me? I bet B&N does...]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I have beena bad wushu person.  I didn't go all weekend, including Friday.  Skipped Monday to hang with the wife (defiantly worth it).  Yesterday (Wednesday), I didn't make it because I was going editing work.  Today I can't because I am going with other wushu friends to chi some fan.

I feel like it has been a month, or at least a few weeks, since I trained.  But a day and a half since I trained is pretty long too.  And before that I went <b>4</b> days!

Yeah, I got issues.

Josh did point out to me that I have been training for months with the same intensity as an Olympic athlete, and that I need to rest, have a beer or drink a book.  At first I thought that was a great idea ' but I can't.  Now is the time for pushing harder.

I'll drink beer when I am dead.

It's time to do another film.  Peking Duck might need some slapping around to get moving again, but it's time.  Plus, we needa do at least one little project before some of out talent leaves for Brazil.  Now I got to figure out what story to do ' maybe it's time for a music video ' or something.  I just don't want to do Cards or the Weiqi ideas just yet, too much infrastructure and planning are needed for those. I am feeling a plot (and duration) along the lines of doughnut or hammock'but with better choreography and cinematography.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[We got free Starbucks at the office today.  But, it wasn't that good.  Seeing a guy dressed up in a giant peapod costume was worth it though.

My hamstrings are still sore from Friday.  When I was training every day for months I didn't get all tender-thigh'ed, but I have one light week of training and my legs hurt.  I thought rest was supposed to be good for you.  Gotta go back and hammer on the conditioning more.

We finally got out new couch, I otta take a picture.  It's the greatest couch ever, and it damn well ought to be -- we paid enough for it.  I was all worried that it wouldn't fit in the door, but the back comes off and the delivery guys were able to walk it right in.  Feel free tom come over and see it, but I don't think we will be letting anyone sit on it anytime soon, including us.  Unless we have just taken a shower, and are wearing fresh clean white clothes, with no metal fasteners, and haven't eaten for at least 2 hours.

It is fun to look at.  Pretty nice, as far as furniture goes. But still, it's got nothing on the [Foof](http://www.foofchair.com)]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/blog/image/595/canongl2.gif" align="left">Yay I got my camera!  A brand spanking new GL-2!  Excited to no end.  Now I must go film!

Of course I also got that noise on my jeep checked out and it was a cracked exhaust manifold.  The dealer wants $1500 to fix it. I think I may be making a trip to Richmond to fix it -- or get it fixed at a mechanic that my dad uses.  He was quite helpful, lemme tell you something, if you are my dad's son and have some sorta car question you can call him, and he may not know, but he will gladly do all the research for you -- doesn't matter if you could just as easily do it for your self, but he will hook you up.  Best part of this would be getting to hang out and work on the heep with crazy Julio.

Jeep issues aside, I am moving my efforts into our next short film.  I think I am going to go with the same clothes idea.  Two people show up and are wearing the same clothes, a fight ensues.  Later as a funny joke, someone else with the same clothes shows up, something happens.  Clearly I haven't gotten all the details worked out yet.

I got my Kwoon fun pack last night, that was also fun -- and functions as a good motivation to get another short shot.  I am very impressed with their production value.  I figure I will also go spend some time reviewing ZG stuff as I ramp up for our next one.

Training journal:  Wushu was pretty good last night 'cept my hammie never loosened up.  It was OK during basics and jumps, but by the time we got to sections I was unable to do any high kicks.  I wound up sitting out for the last two sections.  Sword class is tonight, so I can take it easy(er) on my legs.  Plus no Carlos == no gymnastics.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<b>For as long as I can remember I have wanted to be a <i>Ninja</i></b>

Well, not a ninja per se, but maybe a ninja turtle or a karate kid. But when I was younger it was all Ninjas all the time, later I would discover Jackie Chan and Jet Li and wanted to be them, but that was an extension of the original idea.

When my dad was stationed in Alaska, we would happen to frequent gas stations - as our car required gas to run.  Well, I have this fuzzy, but very strong memory of practicing my "Kicks" against a brick wall as my father serviced the car in some way.  This was all before I had ever had formal training.  Back when my parents dismissed all my requests to take Karate with a abrupt "it teaches violence."  While the rest of the memory is fuzzy I have a very vivid recollection of my though process for kicking the wall.  I thought maybe, just maybe, some Movie Producer Type Guy would see me and want to put me in his movie because of my mad skills (wait, this was mid 80s, lets say "Rad Skills").  Never did it occur to me that not very many movie producers look for child action talent in gas stations.  On Air force bases. In Alaska. But, that really isn't the point. I think the point is: when I question if I should be spending all my free time involved in some sort of Wushu, Peking Duck, Gymnastics, TKD, or Ninja related activities; well I remember stuff like this and know, <i>yeah, I should be</i>.

With all that said, I skipped wushu last night.  It was a combination of having to pick up the Wife from her office, being really hungry and the crazy weather. Mostly it comes down to Kelly just getting back from Richmond and I wanted to hang out with her.  We had some Hao Chi French food and watched it rain.  Also swung by the Apple store and tapped on a G5.  Looks like a cheese grater.

Spear tonight!  Uber-double-fun.

Hopefully I can get together with some of the PDPers this weekend.  I am pretty sure that I want out next short to be the "same clothes" idea - sounds like a fun one to do.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Labor day weekend recap<ul><li>A few people from PDP got together to practice on Saturday, shot a little. </li>
<li>Hokies Won (What the hell happened in the 3rd quarter?).</li>
<li>Ate lots of <i>football</i> food. Mmmm, nachos.</li>
<li>PDP met up on Monday to do a short (but real) project.  Went nowhere, I ate the doughnuts at home later that evening.  </li></ul>
I was pretty frustrated on Monday when we were trying to film.  People showing up late and others speculating about the death of the group, which consists of mostly me harassing people would otherwise not do any of this stuff at all.  People gotta understand that we need to vent sometimes.  It's not the end of the world and there is no reason to always act that way.

On the plus side we got a decent practice in on Monday, and we are supposed to meet up tonight at capital for some more practicing.

I want my wall flip back.  Bad. Don't know how to practice it -- no walls at Capital that could take it.  I'll ask Carlos about it tonight.  I could always get some balls and just go for it at wushu.  Such a wuss. *sigh*]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I used my guiding sword a little last night, because Stephan hasn't been able to replace his broken one yet, that sucka is heavy.  Wrist pain city.  I still may go back and use it a little because it is so heavy -- but aside form being slow and easy to hurt your self with, it feels solid.  Such a nice balance -- maybe I just need stronger wrists.

Oh, I did wall flips last night.  Kelly said she was proud.  Yay me!

Actually, they were more like pole flips, and I didn't do any sans-spotter.  I was such a wuss in that regard.  I never crashed, I never <i>needed</i> a spot, but I just wanted the insurance there. I will get Carlos to spot me again next week and then I <b>have</b> to try on my own.  Even the one I messed up and rushed through turned out fine -- I made it to my feet.  Never came close to landing on my head or smacking the wall'so I needa go for it.  I also wanna learn how to spot like Carlos can, that guy is a crazy spotting machine.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Best weather ever.  It is so nice out side, and it was all weekend.  I skipped wushu both on Friday and Saturday because of it.  Friday Kelly and I were down in old town to see our broker lady.  It was so nice out side that we just had to walk around and stop in at La Piazza for some Italian grub.  Saturday, same thing, went and dropped off the exhaust manifold at the mechanic's and would up meeting J for some uber great Greek food.  (I had an urge) But that resulted in no wushu.  However, we went and played on a playground.  Everyone got sick on the marry-go-round -- except me, of course.  We even went and test-drove a MINI.  The MINI was pretty swell, but I don't think it is going to fit the bill. So sad.  I really like that car, the S is pretty spunky too. After the MINI dealer, we swung by Carmax to check out their prices on Jeep sto get a idea of what to ask and couldn't help but notice that there were a lot of nice cars there that would suit me just fine.  And much cheaper than new.  I think the 5-8 grand that I would save on a used car is gonna be worth it for me.

Kelly and I are being plagued by the "I don't think we will ever be able to afford a house" demon. They are just so expensive here.  Seriously, a town house with a one car garage down the street from out current apartment is half a million dollars!  I really don't think we can put down enough unless we live far away.  Like Richmond.  Hmm, Waldorf is cheap, and it would only be a few hour drive EVERY DAY!  Agghhhag! If prices only go up, how can we afford to wait?  But how can we afford to get in?  How can anyone afford anything?

Wait and save and save some more.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[My quads are sore.  I blame Jason.  He was the one that lead class on Monday, and well, made us do a buttload of frog jumps.  After a few qing-wa tiao races we were toasted.  Of course Jason threw in fidy crunches and a bunch o ab-o-rators, but my abs != hurt.  Me quads == ouchy.

Well, I did more successful wall flips last night.  Still used a spotter every time.  Still never needed the spotter.  I don't know why they freak me out.  The strange thing about the wall flips is my "6th sense" is all screwed up.  Back in VT Gymnastics when John was teaching my back tucks he explained the need to develop a 6th sense, a sense of where you are in the air.  This way you know if you need to pull over harder or open up and take your time. Pretty much you learn to feel where you are as you flip and spin in relation to the ground.  Well, in the wall flip, you jump off a wall, not the ground.  So I think that throw me off a little.  Of course any new skill takes time go get used to, and I can just drill it until I feel right.  And that is my solution to anything.

Most of my free time has been spent concentrating on buying stuff.  Two things in particular.  A car and a house.  I want to sell the jeep, for a number of reasons.  I have a high APR. I am wasting a perfectly good Jeep commuting on freeways every day. The longer I wait the less I will get for it (wanna sell before I break 60K).  And most of all I am ready for a car.  I have always like small sporty fun cars.  So I am ready to get one.   Thinking of the car is not too stressful.  Thinking of a house, well, is.  And mostly it is the thought of getting a down payment for a house in the DC area.  Looks like we will have to drop at least $200 grand to bet a place we will fit into, and that would include a newer bigger longer commute.

Perhaps later today I will write up the cars I am considering, for now here is a short list of the ones I like:
GTI (used)
MINI
WRX Wagon (used)
Focus SVT
Civic Si

I also drove Bryan's brand new Matrix and liked it a decent amount, but it have a few things I don't much care for, like, you ride pretty high -- and that seems to make it feel more un-sporty and top heavy.  I did like the interior layout and all the space.  Ah, I'll save the rest of this for more a involved write up.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I am fretting about the Jeep now.  I posted an ad on cars.com and put up a message on the BB here at work, so it is starting to get close.  I havn't gotten any calls yet or anything but my jeep may soon be gone.  I was putting the carpet back, washing it, in and taking pictures for the Ad - but while I was loading the pictures into the computer I just couldn't help but think how nice a jeep it really is.  So I get cold feet a little.

The only real reason for me to sell it is I would really like to have a car-car.  That's pretty much it.

If/When I sell it I am pretty sure I will replace it with a GTI.  Something a few years old. I also like the WRX wagons, but I am not sure how solid it would be.

Psst, you wanna Id'e fixe?

Well, I lightly toasted my right hamstring last night during spear class. The pig jumps to slam - just a little, but I can tell it is hurt and prone for more hurtin'.  Arg.  Overall the class was OK, we got J to run class because Coach had to run off for some demo practice.  Of course that practice ran long, and resulted in us having to stay late for the parents to return and get their non-demoing kids back.  But I ate Chuplas (supreme, no tomatoes) and got to play some chain whip.

I had intended to type something up that was a little more meaningful than a <i>this is what I did today</i> post, but I am fretting. So whatcha gonna do?]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I almost skipped wushu on Saturday to take the Jeep to Carmax and see how much they'd give me, but Kelly didn't like being rushed into it so I went to wushu instead.  I was really glad that I did.  It was the best class I have had in a long time.  It was just me Stephan, and Amina -- later Rene showed.  It was nice because the place was empty except for the three of us.  And we actually pushed hard and did real training.  S was saying that he feels out of shape and would constantly push hard, so I pushed hard and as a result got a great workout.  We did a lot of changquan stuff, which I didn't really want to do, but in the end I was happy I did.  Not to fear, I got in plenty of spear.  I have picked up the large gross movements that are section 3.  One more section to learn and it is drilling till I got it proper.  I like spear.  I like it despite the fact that I feel like throwing up after 2 sections. I have a hard time saying spear in Chinese.  Qiang.  Awkward word.

Sunday was supposed to be laid back day.  Till Coach called Stephan while we (Kelly and Amina were there too) were getting Pho.  I got roped into a demo.  International Children's Festival.  There goes Sunday.  But'.it's at Wolf Trap, coolest place I ever demo'd so far.

The night before wound up crashing over at J & D's house.  And well, J is out of town for some flirting, so it was just D.  And Sean too, 'cause we dragged him along for the ride.  (on a fun side note, we took him shopping and he bought the most expensive shoes he ever bought.  $45 for a pair or Adidas Sambas.  We have corrupted poor 'lil Sean so much.  *cough*cell phone*cough* Muhahah).  Well, to make a tedious and moderately lengthy story short we wound up crashing at D's place.  Not much sleep. Showed up at Wolf Trap and I was double exhausted.

Exhausted or not it was still crazy cool to go back stage there, so cool.  We had dressing rooms and everything.  We did our little bit and everyone complained about how horrible their individual sets were, but praised everyone else's performance...the usual stuff.  I feel a need to get an optional weapon set down so I can use it for demos.  Time to work on some chain whip again.  I really need to choreo a lil 2 section demo-form for that.  Maybe I will play with it after class tonight.  I would go back to pudao, but chain whip is just easier and much flashier.  And I love flash. And sparkles.  But sparkles are not really related to chain whip, I just like them.

Well, I made it late to Chinese school because of the demo, luckily I was able to find my Chinese teacher and got to do a little Chinese before I had to teach.  Turns out the only other tong xue men (classmate) in the class has been shipped off to boarding school.  So I am getting private Chinese lessons.  Least till next week, when Amina says she'll go too. I still hate our book.  Stupid Yale romanization.

The rest of Sunday was spent relaxing and chilling with the wife.  Watched some TV.  Played some Phase 10.

I finished Speaker for the Dead, so I didn't have anything I wanted to read -- made it through a few pages of Neromancer but I am having a hard time getting into that book so far.  I'll just have to force my self to sit down and read it.  Ender and Speaker were so captivating, I am having a hard time not going out and getting another Card book.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I have been having a hard tome communicating my ideas recently.  It's like the same feeling when I am trying to say something in Chinese but have no idea how to form the sentence, much less the words to use. Only, this is with more complex ideas and in my native language. I have the idea in my head, but when I try to form the words together they don't mesh into what I was thinking.  Or the idea takes much more effort and wrong turns than should be needed.

Maybe I should enunciate better.

Things just get twisted around and misunderstood too often. The current I am dealing with is people on Raffi's are "discussing" the score inflation at team trials.  Claiming that all the scores should be exactly what those competitors would get at worlds.  So, if you pull off a 9.5 at teams, you should be right there at worlds. However, everyone thinks (and I agree) that we prolly need to subtract .3 or .4 from everyone's score to get on the scale they would use at worlds.  Now my argument was going to be: does it matter?  Is this just a case of them never intending to be on the same scale as worlds?  It brings to mind the discussions I have had about the Bible.  Many of the people that have problems with the Bible don't take it for what it is.  If the USAWKF always intended to have the scores relative to the competition, then would it even matter?  I don't think so.  Maybe in 2 years they should score us with letter scores instead of numbers.  Maybe colors.  "I got a orange point blue! I win!"

Of course the counter arguments:  the judges need better training.  Human factors should be eliminated with proper training.  We need to prepare for worlds, and should be as close to worlds at possible.

Why post if it is going to be misunderstood and/or otherwise ineffective.  Disillusionment? Yes, I'll take two.  On the upside it can be accounted to a small handful of nerdy guys bickering over the Internet.  If I think of it that way, I just want to train harder.

Speaking of training harder.  I had a long day yesterday but I made it to wushu (albeit a late) for some swording fun.  Chased that with some gymnastics.  Despite my really sleepy state (every time I closed my eyes, I could feel my self drifting off) I was able to get some practicing in.  My back handsprings were really high, so the r.o.-b.h.s.-b.t. was rather awkward.  I did get to drill wall flips, and that went smoothly.  And honestly, that's all I really wanted to work on anyway.

It was cool that Amina went, and Stephan is a dork for dissing us.  Poor guy didn't know what he was missing.

Skipping wushu tonight, Tom asked me to film some stuff.  It shouldn't take too long either.  A pretty cool little project actually, something for school.  He was required to do a stop motion short, but he decided to work in live action.  So he is gonna shoot an action figure in front of a green screen and composite it in with a person.  I getta be that person.  We will film the live action stuff first and he will go through and match things up as he creates the stop motion.  I am excited to see the end project.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[The sadest thing happened last night.  We went to Sweet Water for dinner (that's not he sad part), and I got the jambalaya pasta (also not sad).  Well, I only ate about a 1/3 (no sad) so that I could save the rest for lunch -- well I forgot to take the left over 2/3 home with me.  AIYA!  I seriously stayed up thinking about that $16 meal that I love, yet only got to eat $6 worth.  Hell, I should've tore up a $10 bill.  Or left some jambalaya pasta at the restaurant.  Mmmm, jambalaya pasta.  I'd go get some more, but we are having a hurricane now.

Isabelle has been doing her dance up and down the coast and is hitting VA Beach about now.  We otta be hit around 9 pm tonight.  I went in to work for a few hours this morning, yet they kicked  me out about 11.  Then I sat around and watched TV.  It sprinkled a little, is a lil windy, but nothing to write about.  Perhaps the exciting (hopefully not too exciting) part will happen later tonight.

Here's to hoping that the Hokies play tonight.  And if they do, that we have power so we can watch the game.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[We never lost power.  Water was declared non-potable, but it always flowed.  Phones kept working.  We came out of Isabelle nearly completely unscathed.  Scarcest part was when we were watching the VT/A&M game and the lights would dim causing Kelly to yell at the electricity.  It was nice knowing my UPS was doing it's thing.  I am gonna have to invest in another one for the server and router.

Friday was a post hurricane party.

Saturday I skipped wushu -- which was harder than you might think.  The school wasn't open on Thursday or Friday, but I wanted to go play basketball for the first time in years.  Probably near 4 or 5 years.  I was most impressed with Kelly, when we played Sextons Vs. McHughs she was the only Sexton to get a basket.  Even though I skipped wushu I still got the call to come help with the Parade on Sunday, which, as it turns out was not a problem. Chinese school had been canceled from the storm.

Sunday was the chinese culture thing down in china town.  Best part is china town is so small that we had to go around the block for the parade or else we'd march right out of it.  I had the distinct honor of being the token white guy for the wushu demo.  We had another whitey doing dragon, but you tend to blend in better when doing that.  I was just marching down street -- standing 8 inches over all those around me.  Wearing red silks.  Swinging a sword.  The parade was short and uneventful -- once we got to the end of the line there was a stage and the parade just sorta piled up on top of it self to cram in at the end.  We were the second in line so we wound up right up front.  Basically there was a big crowd all crammed into that last block.  The fun started when we scooted people back and made a circle to do wushu tricks and combos in.  That even developed into sections.  It was a lot of fun.  Jason was doing double legs over 3 and 4 people.  I just wish the people form USWA woulda come over and joined us.  Some of them expressed interest.  Some of them shouted insults.  Quality. Later we had to do a real demo -- regular stuff we always do, the real fun was the tricks circle.

I only did one section during the "real' demo. Which is inspiring me to work on my optional stuff.  I need couple of non-compulsory things to fall back on at these things.  Sure I am in the middle of spear right now, but that is compulsory, and thus, boring.   Plus spear is a frikking long weapon and that makes it hard for demos.  I'll go work on hopping on my butt tonight.

It was crazy how many wushu people were downtown.  Both schools has so many people representing, but I am crazy proud of how O-Mei did.  We didn't have the brand new 1000-foot dragon nor did we put our drum in a BMW convertible, but I liked that.  O-Mei has always been Rocky in its little run down gym.  That other school is nice, it's clean, it's the high tech USSR gym.  I am not trying to infer bad things, just noting what I saw this weekend.  But, I have always tended towards the non <b><i>bling</b></i> things in life.

Nice seeing old friends again.  I talked to the people I wanted to talk to.  I saw DL and her daughter -- it had been so long. I really, really like both of them.  I wish I coulda seen peter again, but maybe it is better that I didn't.

Paula is going away.  She is going away the same day I leave for California. So it is sad that she will be gone, but happy that Kelly and I getta go to LA.  She will be back in November, which to me dosent seem like a long time at all.  Of course I bet Jason feels differently.  (ya shoulda seen em at the restaurant on Saturday night, awwwww)

Now the question is Box Chicken or Italian Sub Day? Who says my job isn't hard?]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I was never a big football fan.  I never really tried to be; there was never any reason.  The kids I hung out with growing up were not into it.  My dad liked it, but he never tried to get me to understand/become involved.  So it wasn't until I went to Tech that I had any interest.  Ironic thing is my wife loves the stuff. Her and her dad would watch NFL when she was growing up.  She really knows all sorts of crazy details.  She told me that daddy always said that it would help when she met a guy.  Poor girl.  Kelly keeps saying that she could turn into a college football junkie.  Is it strange to make a point to get into football mroe to hang with the wife?  I have found it surprising how the more you know and watch the more fun it is.  Even watching Monday night stuff last night was good.  Not like watching TV where you sit quietly and don't interact - but you yell, discuss, complain, speculate and cheer.

She puts up with wushu; I can watch some football, right?  And this gives me something to talk about with the work fellas.

Oh, right, wushu.  I worked on some chain whip last night.  Rene was there and helped me out with some things.  I have a horrible time with the one handed spin thing, I kept almost getting it, but it never really happened. I also showed up and we lacked a coach so I wound up running advanced class, so we did lots of butterflies.

Tonight gymnastics, and a number of wushu peeps otta be coming along.  Wall flips and aerial twists.

I know more about gymnastics than Kelly, so I am still a <b>MAN</b>.  RAH!      Er...]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I needa rewrite and better organize this, but not today:

I was reading [Jason R](http://www.xanga.com/home.aspx?user=jason_r)'s page and I noticed something that I have often noted in my training.  And not just Wushu, but in Engineering-type situations also.  I have noticed that people don't' tend to get good at a specific skill just by training that skill alone.  That people really perfect it by moving onto the next (harder) skill.  For example, in EE classes I struggled in signals class.  The worst time figuring stuff out.  Laplace and Fourier transforms were killing me, but once I moved on to harder stuff, those things seemed intuitive.  I understand that I needed to crunch away and get the practice in with the basics so that I get a general understanding, but I don't think I would have ever mastered them if I had not been forced into problems that simply assumed you knew how they worked.

I think the same goes for wushu.  I have seen beginners drill away at basics, and they do get better, but once they have gotten to a point where they learn new skills and more complicated movements they also take a big leap in their basics.  Again, like the EE skills, the wushu skills cannot be rushed too fast, because I have also seen a bazillion people doing the new compulsory that really just need to go back and figure out how to step into a bow stance.

Now the trick is figuring out when a particular student is ready to make the transition from drilling a specific basic skill to a more advanced one.  We don't want to get hung up on the <i>traditional</i> way of doing things and force our students to do horse stances for 10 years before we teach them to kick, that simply wastes time.  While rushing through tends to result in poor basics, I think it would be more correctable if the coach simply calls attention to them as the student trains the advanced stuff.

So it's not so much that you rush through things, but rather keep moving along, keep challenging the student, but keep them in check so they know what they are doing wrong and what they need to do to fix it.  If the student has bad habits and knows it, he may just dismiss it as "his way" -- so the coach needs to be jumping on him to get it right.  And most importantly, a teacher cannot loose patience with the same corrections.  However, if the same problem persists, yelling the same correction is not going to help anyone, so he must also analyze why the problem exists and new ideas for solutions.  So many coaches say "go faster" with out any advice on how, or any idea why there is slowness.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[After the trip I got to sleep in nice and late because I was only working a half-day.  Kelly was the smart one and took the entire day off so she got to stay in her sleepy pants and chill at the house.  I didn't need to go to work, but it was a good idea.  So I did. Actually had stuff to do, so it was a good thing I went.

I got my sway bar link for the jeep yesterday, but it was the wrong one.  They sent me a link for a 76-86 CJ, but that won't work with my TJ, something about leaf springs vs. coils.  Bah.  So I called 4WD back and they said that they don't have one so I'll have to go to the dealer.

I went to wushu last night, but skipped gymnastics.  Wushu was pretty good, sword class is always a fun class.  However I get the most frustrated in that class because I think sword is prolly my worst event.  I feel that I just look awkward in sword; I know I competed well with it but I still have quite a ways to go before I will be comfortable with it.  I think I need to video tape it so I can see what I am doing.  Need to remember to take my camera to class.

I skipped gymnastics because Kelly called and said she wanted to have dinner with me, normally she is in Richmond on Tuesday nights, plus I was spoiled by being with her every waking moment for the weekend, so I went home to see her.  If I had gone to the gym she would be asleep before I got home and gone by the time I woke up in the morning.  I really wanna work on wall flips though. Next week, plus next week my coworkers say they wanna come.  Great fun.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I am finally feeling at home at O-Mei now.  Something about how I got back from my trip to cali and people asked how it was.  It was just comfortable.  It is not really the tight group that I used to have, but some of that is the age difference -- before we were all (for the most part) post-college pre-kids twenty-somethings that did wushu.  But things are starting to get to a point that really makes hanging out really cool.  Sucks that people keep leaving.  Come back Paula!  And Lucas for that matter.  The biggest annoyance is the Maryland location, 'cause that means that Stephan or Be (or coach!) will be MIA on any given day, so I only get to see/train with them a couple days a week.

Wo you yi dian bu shu fu.  My throat is a little sore -- yesterday I wok up and there was one spot in the back of my throat that hurt, and throughout the day I just continued to get flemmy.  So I bailed on wushu (I did train taiji), and tried to go to be early.  I am not sure if I should go to wushu tonight, and if I go should I push hard?  Illness is the worst.  I don't know what I should do, it's just a little cold (or maybe just allergies).  I am currently planning on going, and trying to take it a little easy.  But that brings up another question: Staff or Spear?  Tournament next weekend, so I will need to compete in staff (if I want a decent score), but I want to learn more spear.

Don't all them doctor types say you should rest if you are sick?  Well, how sick do you have to be to start resting? A sniffle? Scratchy throat? Fever?  I don't know these things.  Aiya.

I talked to my mechanic (Dave at The Car Connection) and he said that I needa replace both sway bar links on my jeep.  If one is gone, then the other prolly isn't far off. That being the case, I ordered some Teraflex Quick Disconnects.  They were $85 for the pair, and the dealer wanted $45 each for the stock arms.  $90 for stock or $90 for cool aftermarket fun.  Easy decision.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Saturday I wet to the 10 a.m. taiji class when Kelly and Jeannie went off to the spa.  Good class, and as Sean says "Debbie rocks" amazing taiji and a good teacher, IMO. I took off after class, promising my self that I would come back for the 1 p.m. wushu class.  So, there I am sitting at home, flipping channels and I notice that the helmet has a VT on it.  Tech game.  OK, Rutgers.  7 to 0.  Not bad.  Wait, it's Rutgers 7 and Tech 0.  Ack!  I had to watch.  Where was Kelly, and why wasn't she appreciating me appreciating football.  I had this overwhelming urge to wear VT paraphernalia.  Which is not so uncommon, I get that urge on any given day, but this time it was a little stronger than normal.  So I grabbed my tech hat with the Chinese "bird" on the front.  Whew.  By the time 1 o'clock rolled around we had 3 touchdowns and Randall was smacking them around as he should.  So I popped a decongestant and went back to O-Mei.  Didn't think I was gonna go did you?  Well, I didn't either.

That class I was way under performing, I missed my tornado split.  When we were doing full set, doing a full set where coach said that if we touched the ground that we would have to star over.  She didn't make us start over and explained that she was taking it easy on me because I was sick.  That just made me more frustrated that I missed it.  One of the kids was trying to make me feel better and say that everyone has off days.  That added to my already, um... too much frustration.

Chinese school on Sunday was pretty good, well, wushu class at least.  Chinese class was canceled, as our teacher was in a parade.  I finally got Aminia there for class and there was no class.  However, she did return and help me teach wushu.  Things were much easier with her help, it's just too bad she will only be here a semester.  Perhaps I can ask around at O-Mei if anyone would be free to help coach next year after A leaves for china.  I have noticed that I am being more and more strict with the kids, and especially now that the class is getting bigger it is really needed.

We successfully switched over to learning Form 1, and I needa pick up the 8 step drill they do at O-Mei for the little kids.  The Beijing Basic form that I used to teach is simply too detailed and complicated for 8 year old kids that train once a week for an hour, normally one 3 times a month.  Excluding summers.  I am really glad I went back to teaching there, I know it is annoying to have my weekends tied up because of an hour on Sunday afternoon, but I am learning a lot about teaching wushu to little kids.  I felt like I had a good grasp on teaching TKD to the chillins but Wushu was a different story.  I cannot teach the same way that I learned at all -- I had too much background and there are too many things I took for granted.  Plus now that Kelly has her bible study at the same time I am in Chinese school it's not like I am leaving her home alone -- now she also has Sunday afternoon obligations, so it makes mine seem easier to fulfill.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[The topic of wushu gear has come up with in the Internet community.  This is a subject that I had put some thought and effort into in the past.  The obvious side effect to gear would be money.  If we can get/start/spin off a company that produces quality gear for wushu, and if they can pull in a profit then they in turn can put the money into sponsorships/advertising/etc.  That side effect is what everyone seems to want.  I for one would just like to have the good quality gear.

All the stuff we use now is shoddy.  Sure you can buy our shoes in china for $3, but here in the US they cost $20, and only last 2 months.  I have tried shoes form other sports, but there is always something that doesn't quite work for wushu.

The same goes for the weapons.  So much of the equipment we have could easily be improved with a little thought.  Why are the sword finger guards sharp enough to cut your finger? The swords are unbalanced. The spear tips a thin metal flange.  The staffs break regularly.

We could make a good lightweight sword that is balanced, one that has a replaceable blade so you don't need to waste money every time you nick your blade.  A finger guard that is solid smooth and won't cut your hand.

The spear tips don't even NEED to be a point, the could be rounded (like the guiding broadswords) so that the tip (which is nothing more than a metal flange) won't: 1) get bent every time you drop it and 2) won't -- nay, cannot, impale you if you drive it into your leg, or miss a toss.

I do not currently have the knowledge of metal working that I need to actually do any of these things. The most I can do is smelt lead to make my cheap (quality cheap) swords balanced.  At one point I called around to companies that make carbon fiber products -- sail masts, airplane parts, golf clubs, etc -- to see if I could find a 6' long pole that tapers from 1.5" to 1" and had no luck.  Even if I had found a carbon fiber staff I am not certain that any given pole would work, it may need to be specially coated to prevent splintering.  Again, this is something I know we could have.  The materials and know-how exist, just no body bothers to make a carbon fiber staff that is designed to smack on the ground.  A lighter, stronger, last-longer-ator wushu weapon.

Apparel would be nice, but Adidas basketball pants are pretty much the perfect workout pants and the t-shirt market seems to be cornered by the schools.  Too bad so many schools (oh, and magazines too) have such <b>horrible</b> designs.  So maybe there is a market for that stuff, once people realize that better designs can exist.

Oh, and with my interest in design and branding, I totally agree with Jeff when he said this: <blockquote>Gear can be done for wushu like I discussed before. The trick is coming up with a brand (logo, etc.) and a quality that people will respond to. (Several of us working on this almost have some ideas ready to go public). The key isn't so much equipment per se as it is the brand. </blockquote>
You gotta sell to the emotions.  You gotta make people like it, and so much of that depends on brand development.   Wushu does need a brand.  Wait, no, U.S. Wushu needs a brand.

Please don't let the brand be tiger claw.  Please.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Tuesday I went to Galyans to get Kelly's dad birthday present, but I wound up buying 3 Airzookas.  It was pretty funny to wonder around this huge sports/outdoor store with 3 huge bright neon boxes that say AIRZOOKA on them.  But they were on sale, and I can give them away as presents.  Of course I will keep one for my self...

I missed wushu because I was going to a happy hour.  It just didn't seem to be a good idea to go to wushu after drinking.  Even though we all know that one guy who does that.  You know who I am talking about.  Yeaaah.

I still haven't had a chance to install my sway bar quick disconnects on the jeep.  I am pretty annoyed that I have had them for a couple days but I still drive on that broken linkage.  It's been a good 2 weeks since I noticed it was going, but I simply haven't had time and I need to drive.  So far I have been pretty good about going nice and slow around turns and making sure to be smooth and easy on any freeway maneuvers.  I still don't like it.  I will drive to work tomorrow again on the broken one, and plan on using Kelly's car to get my to the tournament on Saturday, so I will fix it on Sunday.  I hope. I do have Chinese school.  Perhaps I can shoot it with my airzooka.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Yesterday I installed the sway bar quick disconnects on my jeep.  It is a pretty easy install on the TJ, but the stock sway bar links decided they didn't wanna come out. The bolt holding the linkage was rusted in there solid.  I have the bottoms of both linkages free, well one side the joint was completely busted so it was just a ball joint on a bolt, but neither wanted to budge.  So I banged on them with a hammer.  Yanked at it with vice grips and nothing.  Eventually I had to remove the entire anti-sway bar -- at first I thought that was going to involve removing the front grille, but with a combination of 3 ratchet extensions I was able to trick the bolt on coming off.  Once I had the big ole bar off it was easy to hammer the bolts out.  This time with a minimum of swearing.

Yeah, every time I work on the jeep I like it more.  Except when I cannot get something done.  Like if a bolt freezes. But once I get it all working I am happy.  I don't think I will be able to sell it even if I got good offers.  Which I haven't.  In fact, I have only had one call about it -- and I wanted to tell they guy that I wouldn't sell it.

Despite all the banging of metal on metal I did still make it to wushu. Staff class.  Next week I get to switch back to spear.  Well, unless I decided to go to this ever hearts tournament in November, I would compete with staff in that too.  I really like staff -- but spear is all new and fun.  Which all reminds me that I really need to go back and not-forget the broadsword form.  Or at least revisit my individual one.

Spear has screwed up the end of my section 3, now, after the running inside I want to spin too much.  I could easily do an extra one.

Individuals after everyone one gets back form worlds!  (See, I'm not bitter.  At least no much)  C'mon cool new forms!]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Short weekend.  We stared things off by going to the Yin Yang tournament.  My results were pretty good (2 gold, 1 silver), but I was not happy with my performance.  And after watching it on tape I was really not happy with my performance.  This unhappiness lead me to sitting on the floor totally obsessed with what I need to do to improve my wushu.  Even after we finished watching the video and everyone else moved on to playing cards I was just sitting off to the side.  Going over wushu in my head.  Eventually this led to watching China Nationals VCD's and that in turn led to the decision that I will not wait any longer to come up with an individual form.  Of course this just heaps on the already heaping heap of wushu stuff I am working on right now.

Todo:<ul><li>Individual chang quan</li><li>9 section whip</li><li>24 Taiji</li><li>Spear</li></ul>
That's a really long list, wushu-wise.

I don't get to work on 9 section too much, and hopefully I will be able to get coach to let me train my individual on class some.

Sunday I went and trained with Jason, Amina and Co. and was able to come up with a good section 1 and 4, so now I just need to fill on the middle parts.  Section 1 does have  a pass that is jump front snap - aerial - twist that may need to be shortened if I run too far.  And I have no good ideas for where to put a tornado.  Of course there were people in the china games that didn't have any tornados in their long fist, but it's the Quintessential wushu skill.

Strange thing.  Kelly is really into the cub's pennant series right now. We've been watching a bunch of baseball as of late.  Not that I am complaining, I find it interesting, but it is still strange.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I was totally unmotivated last night.  I wanted to go home after work and rest some before wushu, but I went to best buy to pick up a VCR.  Well, I went out to the one here in fairlakes, but they didn't have the player I had seen at the Tyson's store.  So I hopped in the jeep and drove out there.  They had the player I wanted, but I was talking to the sales guy and found out that the Daewoo VCR/DVD combo supported VCD, whereas the Allegro one didn't.  I knew the Allegro could be hacked to play them, but I would much rather have native support.  So I was standing there considering buying a frikking Daewoo.  But at $99, it's not that bad, plus it would be hidden in our bedroom. But, in a lucky turn of events there was a open box Toshiba.  It was marked at $105, but the guy marked it down to $99 for me.  It had the remote, but not the manual.  I made sure the return policy was the same for open box stuff (30 days) and went with that.  Took it home and everything seemed to work just fine so I am pretty happy with my purchase.  I can always take it back for a Daewoo if I change my mind.  Ha!

Ahh, but the demotivation continued to wushu.  Wushu wasn't bad, but it wasn't all that good.  I was pretty happy with my workout, overall.  I was pushing for speed and clean movements for most of the class.  Jason started correcting me telling me to 'relax here' and such.  He has this amazing ability to make me listen to him and actually try to do what he says.  I think that is stems from the understanding that he actually sees the problem, understands what causes it and knows how to fix it, otherwise he would not be saying anything at all.  So many people try to help, and while they can see the problem they don't understand what causes it and how to fix it.  I need to keep my mouth shut unless I am certain that I understand all three.   I also gotta give Amina credit in reminding me to breathe ' I am really bad about it, and if I am forgetting to do it and hear someone yell, 'breathe!'

Stephan gave me a great little trick to help my aerial: kick your leg straight back.  I still bend a little in it, but I am getting better (according to the accounts I have gotten, and I hope they would say if I wasn't any better).

By the time I was at Gymnastics I lacked all inspiration and motivation.  I tried to psych my self up on the drive down, saying that <i>I must train I must get better</i>, but it didn't have too much effect.  I didn't even do wall flips, which was pretty much the only thing I really wanted to train. Gymanstics would have been a total bust if Sean had not been there to learn butterfly twists (he is getting really close).  We took the rope down form between the cheerleading floor and the squishy mats behind the vault.  I tried a few hyper twists with no better luck than normal, and then did the setup for a Butterfly-butterfly twist.  Then tried one and crashed it on purpose. After that I was fine, landing them every time.  I wasn't even gonna try them on the floor (I was unmotivated), but I slapped my self and said I had to do it.  No problem, it was easy ' why did it take me this long to get the guts to try.  I always need build up the new things so slowly; it takes forever to get a new trick.

Now to see if I can do a twist after 25 butterflies, like that kid in china could.  Cai yang was crazy-go-nuts.

My individual form is still coming along, I needa show it to coach, and a butterfly-butterfly twist to it, but I like it so far.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<i>Kill Bill</i> was "Enh" -- Wushu on friday was better than the movie.  So was dinner -- the waitress at Peking Village knows me and stephan now, so she cam up to me and told me "only chinese, ni men bu neng shou yingwen" which was pretty cool.  I sorta felt all smug after Nan's cousin reacted with a "woah" when us whities -- and stephan too -- started talking in chinese with the waitress.  Of course that smugness quickly left once I tried to say something more complicated that "one order of fast garlic eight chicken and two orders of pan fried dumplings"

Saturday class was fun, but not too productive.  I spent alot of time not doing wushu.  Taking pictures for the team and messing around with my optional stuff.  I did sit down and read the new rules a bit and found that the backflip coach put in my forms has to come out because only nanquan can do standing back tucks.  In-fact nanquan has alot of cooler high difficulty movements.  However the beginning coach helped me with is pretty fun.

T's Party on saturday was a blast.  It was really cool to chill with the workers -- my team rocks.  er. I mean: <i>r0x0rZ!</i>

Time for chinese school!  So I will leave you with a palindrome, have fun reading it backwards:

Egads a bass tone denotes a bad age.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I am so happy to have iTunes for windows.  Yeah, it's a geeky nerdy thing, but I am spoiled by it at home.  But at home I don't ever listen to music on the computer.  But if I am gonna have to code all day I would like some nice tunes.  Winamp is nice, but it had been running away with my page files.  Musicmatch is on the list next to Real.  *Sigh* I know it's sad.  But I am happy that I am sad.  Or maybe I am sad that I am flying.

I felt bad for A during Chinese class.  I think she was getting upset at one point, and I totally understand.  That class dose not have a polite structure, there is not clear path to follow form the beginning.  Nor is there a clear path ever.  It totally lacks direction, and the book is horrible.  Really, really bad. Doesn't even use Pinyin.  So I spend half the time transposing from Yale to Pinyin.  I think the biggest problem is that I have spent countless hours repeating Chinese sentences and I had no freaking clue what they meant.

Of course it is free, and the time is good for me and the rest of my schedule.  The flexibility is good if you can have the will power to force your self to go and learn.

But then again, there was some new girl there last time.  She is young, and speaks good Chinese, but is there to "read and write"  -- doesn't make that much since in a conversational language class.  She was way too helpful.  Event he teacher was getting annoyed when she tried to help.  Always offering suggestions or solutions to our problems.  Or non-problems.  Or problems that were not problems until the solution was enforced upon us by a little girl. <i>I just wanna learn, is that so wrong?</i>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Everyone is getting ready for worlds.  I am not gonna hide it.  I am jealous.  People keep talking about what they are going to do once they are free form worlds, but they got the real thing.  In my little world, going to worlds is the big goal.  Sure, they are stuck training compulsories - but what form you do isn't important.

Jason, Stephan, Jessica, Felicia, Debbie, and Justin - you guys own it.  Go give China a hard time.

For my wushu struggles I have been piddling around with my optional for too long.  I can't settle on a section one, much less 2, 3 and 4.  I have got to settle on something and go with it, at least for a while.  I watched it on video and was pretty disappointed, I look all tall and awkward.  A few things were better than I thought (standing jump outside), but overall ppffftttt.

We gots testing again this weekend, and coach wants all the worlds peeps to use it as a practice.  Well, I am gonna do the testing too, but that means I am doing compulsories.  Hopefully I will only need two sets, not three.

In other, related, news we have has a sudden surge in interest in filmmaking and tricks, nothing is solid and fo-sho, but I am hopeful.  I really want to get this [cellphone commercial](http://www.fuzzymonk.com/pd/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=216) idea a reality.

Oh, Kelly went out of town for 3 days this week. That sucks.  Kelly, don't go away for and more than zero days each week.  Thanks.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Ok, so the coworkers think I am nuts.  But it drove me crazy to see the guy at McD's to throw away a Best Buy Buck.  I dug through the trash for a min or two screaming "come back dollar!"  but I never found it.  I stood there and watched (it happened in slow motion) as he threw it away.  I almost asked if he wanted that'but figured he would say yes for sure.  I mean, how can you not want a best buy buck?  Aiya!

I also decided I like football video games, so now I need trick the wife into wanting one too so I can have football fun with the video games.  And also also I hate the xbox controllers.  Does Microsoft think we have some sorta giant hands with little pencil-like finger tips?  Really.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last year I didn't like the book, this year I <b>hate</b> it.  And I am not sure you can even call it a book.  It is a Xerox of a early 70's era Chinese language book.  Frustration of frustrations.  It does not have pinyin, even Taiwan is using pinyin despite their best attempts at sticking to bopomofo, despite all the political efforts to avoit all things mainland.  If they think it is so standard that they need to use it, then, dammit, lemme use it too.

Currently I am taking the Chinese class in exchange for teaching wushu.  There are 3 people in my class.  Me, Amina and some little girl that already speaks Chinese.  The little girl is getting nothing out of the class as far as I can tell; she is there to learn the characters - however the teacher has yet to teach anything as basic as stroke order.  Amina is trying to take her first real Chinese class and needs to learn thing like "my name is" or "Chinese" in Chinese.  Not "shower head".    I also have little interest in screwing up my pinyin skills with Yale Romanization, er, I mean <b>Bastardization!</b>.

I am seriously thinking about asking the teacher if I can use a different book, and if she says no, I will just quit the class.  I mean I would like to keep studying it, but it is just a hobby.  I think it is something cool to learn.  That's it.  I know it could be useful if I am in the wushu world, but it is by no means needed.

Seriously, the teacher calls me "Curtis".  I have been going there almost 2 years. I tried to correct her for a wile but it never took, so I jsut gave up.  Amina normally comes out as "Armenia" -- ugh.

My kids cannot stand still.  Ever.  Oh, how a long to teach 9 year olds!]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Coach and most everyone left for Macao yesterday, Jason and the Zhang Sisters had their last class.  It was a very relaxed class, part of it was because I was teaching, and everyone was getting ready to take off for world games and they didn't want to kill them selves the night before they fly out.  Actually, we got them to do plenty of working out, but we had a bunch of fun too (least I think so)

Class didn't really get going till we were 25 min into the regular time.  We spent osme time worming up and jumping around.  Then we tried to get Jason to teach us a fun game, but the game was sorta unrelated to wushu in pretty much every way.  We really need more wushu related games to play.  Back in VT Gymnastics we would have all sorts of fun games we could play.  Normally involved standing in a circle doing back tucks (or some other skill) until people started crashing them.  But it would really work your tucks, plus it's fun.

We would also play "show me" on the tramp - which I thought would be a fun game for wushu, but my implantation was pretty bad.  I just had people add on one movement and then the next person would go.  This sorta resulted a big blob of disjointed moves.  Every once in  a while it would make a fun combo, but those times were not frequent enough to warrant the mass pandemonium.  Of course it may be that we were not used to it enough that we could play it with any finesse.

After class we sorta hung around for a little while, I really wanted to go home and see Kelly, but I also wanted to chill with everyone before they fled the country.  We goofed around a little, practiced some tornado-horse stance with crossed arms and jump-outsides and I decided I needed to go harass the woman.  I wished everyone g'luck and I was really excited for them.  By the time I got out to the jeep I was thoroughly jealous that I couldn't go.  Not that they shouldn't and I should (they do have a much higher skill level), but I wanna too.

Kinda like testing last Saturday, which could be summed up on one quote from coach: "Good job US Team Members and then Chris."  Honestly, when I first heard that I thought it was pretty funny.  But it sorta stuck on my mind.  And the more I thought about it the more I am determined to train like crazy for the next two years.

But even that, in more ways than one, sucks.  Training takes up so much time and effort.  I am gonna really owe Kelly after all she puts up with.

Funner Kelly note:  We were grabbing dinner and talking about nothing in particular, when I brought up Madden 2004.  Kelly got all bright and her eyes were wide and happy when she told me about the feature in EA's NCAA Football that allows you to save the players that graduate and then load them into Madden for the draft.  My wife is an interesting person.  Of course,  when I suggested switching sides for the bed she counter-suggested that we sleep upside down.  I don't even know what the means.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[We got to meet J's bo for the first time this weekend.  Cool guy, he really fits her <i>type</i>, IMHO.  Over all things were relatively uneventful -- watched the game (which, in it self was eventful) on Saturday, and had dinner over at our place on Sunday.  The game was awesome; I have never been into a football game so much.  I was nervous right up until the end.  Some how I was thinking that we were going to blow a  24 point lead with a minute left.   Nervousness was unwarranted.  Sunday we got hang with S along with the Mc's (and new bo) and play games.  Cranium, Euchre, Spades, Madden 2004, SSX -- all seemed to flow together nicely.

OK, I am ready for Coach and Co to come back.  I do enjoy teaching, but it is really draining.  The lifting in the morning, working all day, going straight to wushu and teaching for a few hours and getting in some real training leaves me pretty stinkin' tired.  And it's not like I have been doing it for a few weeks yet, more like 3 days.  Pathetic.  Perhaps I will feel better nearer the end of the week when I have had time to adapt to everything.  But at this rate I doubt I will be able to make it to gymnastics.  Training from 5pm to 11pm is long time.  We'll see on Tuesday.  I wanna go, and Kelly <i>is</i> our of town...

Chinese school was 50/50 this weekend.  The strange think was language went (relatively) well, and wushu was a bit annoying.  My Laoshi agreed to use [the book](http://www.chinasprout.com/store/B259.html) I used for my first zhongwen class, of course it depends on the price.  And the price is $31, which is prolly expensive in the Chinese school setting. As far as the wushu class, my kids were pretty adamant about their lack of attention. To their credit a lot of the class was not run with the normal structure they are used to.  One of the parents wanted to take a picture so that they could use it to make a flyer for next year, and all the kids had one of two opinions.  They either A) did not give a flying crap and wanted to do nothing but lie on the floor and punch/push/pull/grab their classmates or B) thought it was embarrassing and stupid.  I loved the kids on group B, at least they could stand still while I was yelling at them.  When we finally transitioned to forms I was moderately happy with their performance. Note, that by 'performance' I mean their performance in paying attention and following directions (and knowing left from right), not really their wushu skill.  Double note, I need to talk to A's parents, she could be really good -- I am gonna suggest they take her to a more productive [setting](http://www.omei-wushu.com).

Once a week for 8 months a year is not enough time to convey any wushu understanding to 7 year olds.  Forget about the younger kids.  Aiya.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<b>Lord of the Flies</b>

It's strange enough hearing about an office building in NOVA that had fly infestations, but apparently it is more of a wide spread problem. In fact, they don't even stick to office buildings at all. I would be willing to wager that them flies would even infest a residential building. Like, say a town house. The reason I would be willing to bet on that is because I had flies invading my bedroom last night.

I wondered into the room after my shower and notice something on the ceiling. So I do what any man in my position would do: I grab an orange towel and snap it at him. Direct hit. Only the fly is still flying around the room. Wait, no, now two flies are flying around the room. So I continue to snap the towel at the first fly (I think it's still him, flies are hard to tell apart), hitting him maybe 3 times with vary little luck.  That sucker is tuff.  The second bug has settled nicely off to the side and is just watching everything form the ceiling. After carefully sneaking up under him, I snap him real good. He drops like a fly, surprisingly enough. I use the towel to brush him off to the side. I also stood there and gloated, because after besting that ferocious fly I proved that I am clearly the master of my domain.

Back to the first fly. Only he is insisting on driving his person into the light on my ceiling as hard and as frequently as he can. Well, I didn't really want a shower of broken glass raining down on the bead, so I decided I should not snap the towel at him when he is sitting on the light (after a few min of driving full force into the light Mr. Fly would get tired and rest. That's when I had a great epiphany: the fly likes the light. So I lightly swing my deadly towel and brush the light and get the fly airborne, and shut off the light. I hear buzzing of the fly's wings as he bangs into the ceiling for 30 seconds or so. It stops. My ears perk up and I hold my towel in a low fighting stance, looking up. Flip on the lights and scan overhead. That black spot is a dead give away, because, well, a fly looks like a black spot on a white ceiling. Snap! Then I tower gloriously over my victim.

Now the task of finding out how these little flies got into the room. The tops of the windows have had a tendency of dropping own a bit, and since the tops lack screens I figured they might have entered that way. I pull the blinds up on the big window and to my horror I see those tell-tale black spots, three of them. Odd thing is the window was cracked just a little, not quite enough for these flies to squeeze in. But I would have to figure out that little mystery later, these intruders needed vanquishing.

My first reaction is to open the window and shoo the flies out. So I open the top of the window a good 8, 9 inches, lower the blinds and twist them as tightly closed as I can. They are now trapped between the blinds and the window. I then shook the blinds to encourage the flies to take flight and head out to freedom. They didn't move. So I shook harder. Two flies few thought the blinds, like they were not even there. Now they were buzzing around he room mockingly.  However they quickly discovered the light to slam into, and their mocking flight pattern was forgotten in lieu of a the great light discovery. That thing is like catnip for flies.  Fly nip.

I did the only thing I could do.

I jumped around snapping and turning the lights on and off. But with three adversaries I decided I needed assistance. "Kelly!!!" I shouted repeatedly. After, I donno, yelling for a long time at the top of my lungs, I decided I really needed her help. I walked over and opened the door to ask for her aid. I enlightened her onto the ways of turning off the light so the flies would stop on the ceiling on a place other than on the light. After we handled the second wave of flies (the last one also was able to fly thought the fully closed blinds as well) I was back on duty for trying to discover their point of entry. The little window was open a good 2 inches. And there was another fly hanging out on the window. I asked him to leave. I warned him. Threatened him. Even tried to shoo him out the fully opened window. He opted to fly into the light.

Eventually he was snapped proper.

We were set on the task of disposing of all the fly bodies. I shook the blanket and a fly flew out. He was hiding in the bed. So we dealt with him by smacking him mid air with a mighty swing of the towel. He shot like a rocket toward Kelly and she screamed an assumed a defensive squat. I dance around the room taunting the flies and swing my towel. They seemed to all be down.

As we were grabbing the vacuum to dispose of them proper one started to move again. Kelly grunted and slammed a laundry basket (she prefers larger blunt weapons) and slammed it down on the dazed fella. We vacuumed him up and found the next fly, thinking that surly that last fly amazingly tuff, this one must be dead. Well, she starts to stagger crawl across the floor and buzzes his wings a little. Whomp! Laundry basket. And then before he could come to he gets sucked.

Turns out they are all just unconscious. The one under the shoe rack even starts to fly but I wack him repeatedly with my hands much like a puppy, who lacks control of his oversized paws, tries to pounce on a bug. A bug, like a big ant, or a fly.

We track down the remaining flies in turn and check them into Motel Vacuum.  A total of 7.  Seemed like a lot more during the hunting process.

We make sure all the windows are tightly closed. And put are slightly buzzy vacuum back it the closet and try to go to bed. It's hard to fall asleep with all the adrenaline of battle still pumping through your veins.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Wushu went surprisingly well last night.  Perhaps it's because Anita and An showed.  We had like 6 people there to help coach the 5 o'clock class, then I did the 6 (best part is nearly all those people who took taught the 5 came to the 6) and then we did the advanced class all nice: 15 min free warm up.  I then did 15 min of basics (fun stuff, no bo stance punch). 15 min of jumps.  A nice helping of sections and we toped it off with abs.  It worked really well with the crowd there (read: they were al advanced/mature enough to stick to that format).

For my morning lifting I have decided to go back to the dead lift/press stuff I tried a while back at home, only now I have access to a full set of free weights.  I'll try the angry Russian program again and see how it works.  Today my weights were 225/205 dead lift and 135 press.  The press was light, but I was alone and haven't pressed a bar since McComas.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I had a horrible headache last night so I took two Tylenol PMs to help me sleep, and they did a good job, maybe too good because now it is 1pm and I think I am still feeling the effects.  I may just be sleep deprived and need to get more in general.

Nah, it's just the medicine.  Now, where can I get some caffeine?

Everyone got back form worlds this weekend, well 'cept coach who opted to stay till this Friday.  I was going to write that I hadn't heard form anyone but just as I was sitting down to write this Jason messaged me - so I got to chat with him for a min.  I tried to sham him into bringing Paula by the school tonight right after her flight, because we are all dieing to see everyone but he played the ever potent <i>we'll see how she feels</i> card, dammit, how can I argue with that?

I have been in the school for pretty much all my free time for this past week. I seems like I was there more than I was at work, and all we have had to talk about are the games we play for the beginner classes, and the results of worlds. I love all those kids (and the few adults that make the ever-impressive attempt at wushu) but I miss all our mature (I use that word loosely) wushu pals.  I hope Stephan or the Zhang's or Debbie or Bee will show today (I know Bee was here the entire time, but he wasn't <b>here</b> here).

Speaking of games Amina and I have been able to establish two new games at wushu: <i>cross the river</i> and <i>horse stance tag</i>.  I brought the cross the river game back form china where I played with the Boy's BJWT, and it worked <i>OK</i>, the true victory was in Amina's contribution of horse stance tag.  That game is fun, and double fun to watch.  The rules are simple: play normal freeze tag, but when you get frozen you must stand in a horse stance, you are unfrozen when someone crawls through your legs.  It is a little disconcerting to be standing in a horse stance and home someone run at you full speed and slide through your legs.

That game alone was responsible for pulling us out of are "I don't wanna train" funk on Saturday after teaching the morning classes.  I really didn't want to train.  So we played Horse stance tag for 30 minutes.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Crazy how all my training came to a halt once A, J and P<!--Amina, Jason, Paula-->  showed at wushu.  Much happiness.  I also saw S<!--Stephan--> for the first time since he returned -- S is a beast, he is stepping up his training now that he has gone to china and seen the <i>good</i> stuff.  His first day back and he was teaching 2 classes and training/teaching the third.  Dead-ee-cation.

P got me the coolest pants.  I was going to say they were tight, but that didn't sound right in reference to pants.  They are 100% pure Brazilian Capoeira pants, from a good Brazilian friend -- can't beat that with a stick. Jason hooked me up with a 7th world wushu champs shirt, nice shirt, really good quality.  I so wish I coulda gone with them.  I am making a concerted effort to hang with them whenever I can, as their time is limited here.  Even A is leaving for China in a couple months.

I had to cut my chillin' with the peeps short because it was time to go see my wife.  Other people might try to lure me with presents but I hadn't seen Kelly much at all over the last week and needed to go get a fix.  I got potpie and brownies out of the deal too.  She even reminded me how to play gin.  I won (but I have my suspicions that foul play was afoot)

Too bad I forgot to bring any <i>wo de tai tai de hao chi fan</i> with me today for lunch.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Coach totally hooked me up with help on my optional form.  Teaching 3 classes a day for over a week was worth the help she gave me tonight (Ok, ok, <b>I</b> didn't teach ALL the classes by my self, but I was there for a lot of them.  Amina was there too)

We did this crazy cool move in class,  Hard to explain -- like a left hand block and right hand spear as you step across with you right foot and as the spear finishes the extension you do a body turn.  See, I told you it was hard to explain.  Well, I promptly added it to my optional.

Fun class.  She worked us hard.  I am tired.  I gotta go to work tomorrow at 8 am.  Blah.

I was in the car last night on my way to spear class and I called tom back only to find out that his movies were getting screened in an hour.  So I did a u-ie and grabbed Kelly and we shot off to Rosslyn.  So many people were there, it was CARSY fun seeing everyone again.  I really miss all you guys (I will keep you nameless for your safety -- not because I can't remember you names) I really need to "hit the phone and give them" more often.  They are like my NOVA family.  The sorta people that even if you haven't seen them for months and months it feels like you just saw them yesterday.  Perhaps training with people just does that.  'Cause I have the feeling that the people I train with everyday now will eventually become that way.

It's really funny to see which people stand the test of time and which ones don't.  I totally expected different people to remain in my life -- and it's not that I would trade the, um, leftovers for the lost (lostovers?), but it's not what I expected.

Aiya, we got company, I need a shower and I got to be at work at <b>8 am</b>.  Ugh.  I'll have to be nostalgic some other time.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[So this weekend I played Football with James and Co.  I was even able to drag Tom and Danny along.  During this friendly game of tackle football I discovered what I should have known for some time.  Football is meant to be watched.  Don't ever play.  Catch is fun.  Maybe a little two hand touch on the 4th of July, but never play a pickup game of football with a bunch of guys.  The most annoying thing is despite the tackle that injured my neck so that I can no longer look left I want to go play again.  Next Sunday?  I should fully recover by then.

Dumb game, made me miss changquan class on Monday.  Given my current stat of being able to look leftish (not fully left, but leftish), I should be able to hit up some jian and gymnastics tonight.

My haircutter lady has moved form Leomann's Plaza to York Town Plaza!  I used to try to head out Rt 50 to see her, but since I am not out in Loemann's so much anymore it is not so convenient, so I have been going over to York Town -- despite the fact that the ladies there suck at the cutting of hair.  I have had a miniature off-center crooked Mohawk cut into the back of my head there.  Sometimes they totally miss a side.  The crazy Russian lady once trimed my sideburns nice and even.  Stopped, looked me square in the face and cut an extra 3/4 inch off the left side.  For no reason, I had to lean to the side if I wanted my hair to look even.  <i>I said leave them the same length!</i> Yeah, I am pushing the consumer moron envelope by going back there.

Yesterday when I walked in I actually saw the worst of the worst looking right at me (the crazy Russian lady).  We made eye contact; I knew that I was going to get stuck with her.  When to my surprise Diane stood up and offered to help me.  Yay!  No crazy Russian lady to cut my hair!  Lets hear it for the exacting precision of this Vietnamese lady!

Ok, so the last 3 times I came to work it was for full day of training.  The training was not fun training like, say, wushu, but rather Java programming for web development.  The training it self was not that bad, some of the topics even bordered on interesting, but overall the class was painful.  We had a mix of technical and functional people.  The functional people that took the class were taking it so they would know if their techies were shoveling BS or not.   I don't think it will help with that.

I propose they offer two classes, one short day long (or better yet, two half day sessions) with nothing but hardcore* stuff, and another class for the managers.  This manager class could be called "How to know when a programmer is lying for dummies."  And just for fun it would be a weeklong class.

The class really wasn't bad, just too slow.  So slow that we went stir crazy.  It got to the point where the people behind us were making strange horn noises.  And every break we would but the vibrating Tigger in a cup and watch him dance.  There is nothing funnier then a vibrating Tigger in a cup.  Except for a vibrating Tigger doing indecent things to a vibrating Eeyore. I am never going to be able to watch Winnie-the-Pooh again.  Poor Eeyore.

*I use the term <i>hardcore</i> very loosely.  This is web programming in java.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I have been a bad wushu student all week.  Sure, I can use the excuse that I hurt my neck playing football and I have stayed away in order to heal, but I still feel like I am slacking.  Last night I skipped long weapon so I could go out with work peeps -- which is a completely valid reason, and was a lot of fun as well.  It's just sad that we have to say goodbye to our manager.  It's also sad that he beat me to a pulp playing checkers.  Which brings me to another point.  Urges.

I have been having the urge to partake in a number of activitys.  Ont of the being somewhat related to Checkers.  Related in the fact that they are both turn based pure strategy games.  Really wanna play some go.  I also wanna go skating at that park we played foot ball at last weekend.  Oh, yeah, I wanna go play football.  Prolly some touch football because this tackle stuff was just plain silly. I wanna go train (I really wanted to train Wednesday when everyone was going to work on optional) but wushu is nto as high on my <b>just gotta</b> list right now.

Agh, actual work.  bbl.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[On Sunday Chinese school proved to be much more useful than normal.  It was probably because I didn't have any classmates for the language class and the one on one tutoring was actually useful.  It may not have been the one on one that was so useful; it could have been the fact that Chu Laoshi let me switch to a different book.  Of course she didn't choose the book I brought in (I even offered to give her a copy), but it uses standard Pinyin.  It also uses simplified, which is fine by me, but up to this point I had been learning traditional. Oh, if you are interested the book is <i>A Key to Chinese Speech and Writing</i>, strangely enough the non-chinese author is a non-english speaker -- instead he is a French fella.  Yay for one more layer of abstraction.

I seriously cannot wait for thanksgiving, I have been craving all the regular thanksgiving foods and because it's only a few days away I am having a hard time convincing Kelly to roast us a turkey and make pumpkin pie.  It's not like if we eat that stuff now we can't eat it later this week.

As far as wushu goes I am still working my individual, only minor changes here and there.  I still need to polish a few things that don't flow.  But before I can really polish them I have to train it for a little while and determine if it is the choreography that is not smooth or if I just haven't given my body enough time to get used the movements.  When I was learning the compulsory I felt like it was so anit-coordinated UNTIL I figured it out.  It may be the same thing for this.

Everyone else is starting to make optional stuff.  It is exciting; we need more and more people to start training their optional.  It's works much better if you have a few people to bounce ideas around.  Plus as we steal movements and borrow combos all our forms will improve.  As we progress as a team I think we will develop a similar flavor in our optionals.  Which is cool, IMO - cause then we can bust out the old school kung fu lines.  "Ahh, interesting technique.  You have trained with the great master from Sichuan.  Prepare for battle!"]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Sword class left me feeling nothing but uncoordinated.  S is so good at sword; it seems o natural for him.  Perhaps it is simply because he loves it so much, or just natural talent.  I totally dig that weapon, but it is stinking hard to push past the moments of uncoordinated spasms with the <i>girl's</i> sword.

Sure, they call the straight sword the "gentleman's sword", but we all know it's the girly one.  Spear too.  Even the IWuF admits to the gender assignments in wushu via their proposed Olympic format.  B-sword - boys; Sword - girls.  I mean, you can tell just by watching the forms, one is all flowy and graceful and the other is slash-a-lishious aggression.  Figures I would pick the one with leaping pirouettes.

Even in gymnastics the guys don't even do aerial cartwheels, much less front aerials, or aerial twists.  Guess what I have been working on?  I gotta go back to training pommel horse again, or maybe some high bar.  Then I can grunt and scratch.

I am not trying to complain, I just wanted to point it out.

Gymnastics was fun last night, but too crowded, I would love to have all the wushu peeps out there, but it got a little out of hand as people resorted to goofing off too much.  There was screaming and falling off the tramp in creative ways.  Eventually everyone calmed down and started working on actual skills, and I was happy.  I just don't want Carlos to get annoyed at the riffraff that gets dragged in (oh, and for the riffraff that may read this, you know your <i>riffraff</i>, so don't even try to deny it).  I had fun with everyone there, and I hope you guys can keep coming and we can all push each other and get better.

I also gotta be more aggressive at getting coaching, I have been going there longer than anyone else and I swear I get the least coaching.  Sure, it may be the unorthodox techniques I choose to train, but other un-ortho's seem to get advice.  I cannot complain because he will help me when I ask for it, so I need to get off my lazy pigu and ask.

It was cool to hang with Bryan, and I don't know if I should be annoyed that Sean left with out a zaijian, or happy because he gave me $5.

Oh, one last note about wushu class: hu zi tiao(rabbit jumps) suck, they burninated my quads.<hr />aI am off to Richmond in an hour or two.  I seriously don't see my family enough.  My nephews are gonna grow up and I will be the crazy estranged uncle.  I want to be around my sister and her family more, not to mention my 'rents (as crazy as they may be.  You know they are crazy).  Plus we get to eat pumpkin pie and cranberries.  Everything will be orange and maroon and centered around turkey.  It's every Hokie's favorite holiday.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Thanksgiving fun for everyone.

Kelly and I had two times the turkey because we got to have thanksgiving twice: the regular Thursday thanksgiving in Richmond (at grandma's house and everything) and a supplementary thanksgiving in the 'Dorf.  Both were great, but I gotta give it to the Tulli for their addition of can-shaped cranberry sauce. B-Ma had the homemade cranberry sauce, and while it may be more aesthetically appealing I just love the cran-can. Fill your fork full of turkey, stuffing and a slice of cranberry flavored gelatin and you are in for a taste explosion.

I missed Cheryl's little dinner, I felt like such a moron.  She clearly stated "Friday" but I had read "Saturday."  I even rescheduled other activates so that we would have Saturday night free.  At least Bryan called me Friday night to see if I was there - 'cause if he didn't I woulda just gone over the Chang's on Saturday.  Awkwardness was avoided.  Or course I also succeeded in avoiding social interaction with a bunch of really good friends.

Wushu on Saturday was interesting; when I showed up we had no power.  So coach left.  It was dark and sad.  Plus we were not allowed to practice any weapons for fear of cutting up our classmates.  Which is understandable, but still sad. Training was good, but kinda petered off there at the end.  I got a few interesting pictures of people partner stretching.  So other people decided to take some pictures.  Which invariably lead to Jason, Bee, Paula and I doing our interpretation of modern dance while people took pictures.

Paula is going away (again), and we had another gathering at my house to send her off (again), but this time we also got to celebrate Her birthday, Amina's Birthday, and last but not least, my birthday.  Actually we met up at Jason's restaurant, where we were treated to some Dim Sum super fun.  They are not even supposed to have dim sum that late in the day but we got it because Jason (and his mom) hooked us up.  It was good stuff.  I have always been a proponent for bacon wrapped deep fried things, and the bacon wrapped deep fried shrimp did not let me down.  A little mayo and them shrimps are <i>good</i>.

At my place we watched a little bit of the world games footage, but the guiding taolu got a little boring so we popped in the 2002 china games.  Yep, we went A.W.: <b>A</b>ll <b>W</b>ushu, so Kelly went upstairs to do work.  But that didn't happen till after we had cake and ice cream.  It was fun to chill with everyone; even Riz stopped by and hung out.  Eventually Sean put in the new Two Towers DVD I got for Kelly.  Over four hours later we were able to go to bed.  That's a stinking long movie.  I still hope that the theaters will offer a "Lord of the Rings" package where you can see all 3 in one sitting.  Sean pointed out that you would probably bet bedsores.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[OK, this has inspired me to avoid any posting on any wushu politics for whatever reason.  I don't recomend that anyone read it, but I want to keep it for my personal records.

It all stared with marco's strife inducing post
<blockquote>Raffi, yo I was wondering... what do the results in Long Fist say about the judging for the U.S. Team trials? For example, Justin And Stephon getting 8.8 and 8.78 vs Dyra getting into 9.10... Does it really say anything about the judging or do we have to wait for the videos to say for sure? </blockquote>
Which would have been fine, but he (and those after) kept citing "Justin and Stephan" directly. They all agreed that cheating was a well known fact and wanted to know what we thought.  So Raffi said,  "Goh/LXL apologists? I'd like to hear your take on it."

I thought about it for a while.  Wrote stuff up and delted it.  Decided that I needed to say something (which was my biggest mistake) and said:
<blockquote>I think that we should support ALL our athletes.

I see loads of support for DY -- which he deserves -- but let's support all our athletes. As far as I could tell that ATHEATES that went to team trials came away with one voice to unite the US wushu world. Weather they made the team or not.

Or is that a lost cause?</blockquote>

They took this to mean that I wanted to ignore the contraversy and pretend it never happened.  I didn't want support for the WKF, just the atheates.  To stop citing their names everytime they had a complaint.

So raffi said
<blockquote>I realize you are classmates with Justin, Stephon, et al, but please realize that when we are pointing out their scores, its not to attack them, its to attack the F'ed up team trials that gave them 9.4s and said they were the best wushu athletes in the USA.

No one says they're not gifted athletes, no one says they don't train hard, no one says they're not trying their best at worlds. what people ARE saying is that the Team Trials, run by Goh, hosted by LXL was BAD! This is proof of it.

The trials said Stephon and Justin were several points higher than everyone else at trials (like DY), it would appear that the World's scores disprove that.

It said that Stephon and Justin, and Jessica and several others were 9.3 and 9.4 level athletes, as it claimed to use IWuF standards. This has been disproven as well...

If its not picking the best people, if its not giving fair scores for each division, then what the hell does it do? (besides populate the team with 75%-87% Omei students!)</blockquote>

Me:<blockquote>OK, I wrote about 10 responses with arguments about that fairness of team trials, reasons why we shouldn't hold to this one (very suspicious, I know) incident, and even reason why everyone needs to kiss Nadir's backside -- but they were all dead points that no one is going to change their POV on so I settled on trying to disassociate my classmates with controversy.

Upsets happen all the time in the world of sports; this is not that unusual or even statistically strange.</blockquote>

Apparently using the word 'upset' means "sorry loosers, learn to cheat better"

Marco's Troll Bait
<blockquote>
Excuse me if I misunderstood your statement, but are you basically
saying it is OK for your school and your teacher to get away with what
they've done cause "hey shit happens?" hmm.. I had a tough time
understanding how people from Omei could deal with the fact that they
are on the team because of the corruption and politics, and the only
justification i could come up with was that they just were unaware of
it. But now it seems you turn around and are telling us "hey ya! We
know our school cheats, we know we are taking advantage of the system,
but you know what? We don't care. cause hey! shit happens!"

That is what I understood from you saying "Upsets happen all the time
in the world of sports; this is not that unusual or even statistically
strange."

I'm going to have to assume that you do not represent the view of your
teammates, as I'm hoping your teammates are more aware and morally
concious than you seem to be.
</blockquote>

My desprate attempt at clearing my name:
<blockquote>Should I also excuse you for directly stating that I am without morals?

I was at team trials, and I do not claim that the scores were on the same scale as the world games, but as a person who was there and competed I do believe that the order people got placed on the team was mostly fair.  I heard many groups complain about it, and understood their arguments but the overall impression I got from the athletes I spoke with was within the divisions it was run fairly.  If one person got screwed on deductions on sword, we all did.  This argument is apparently forgotten because you are speaking like it absolutely decided that my coach cheated to get our athletes ahead.  Do you know how badly I want to jump into the group of people that were hanging out on the bleachers talking about how the white people were getting screwed (I kid you not, they were quite serious), I was very tempted to blame the "anti-white conspiracy" for the 1/100 of a point that I needed to make the team.

You act that you are certain that my coach cheated at trials.  You state it as fact.  I'm sorry, but I don't agree. As a person who has been on both sides of this controversy I feel like I have a pretty well rounded point of view.  Also as a person who has seriously trained with Lu Xiao Lin and her students I feel like I have a very good understanding of what goes on.  I honestly believe that she did everything she could to make things not only appear to be fair, but they actually were.  I have no reason to believe that she has done anything with these team trials that could be considered immoral.  And the more speak with her about these attacks on her character, the more I want to defend her.

Do I think there were issues with team trials?  Yes. Stuff that the USAWKF desperately needed to fix? Absolutely.  Some of the stuff that went on was so messed up, but I do think Lu Xiao Lin acted morally the entire time.  I understand how things look bad, I really do, but I am confident with my conclusions.  Do I think team trials were completely fair and objective?  Well, is not the issue, however I believe my school did not contribute to any skewing of the results.  And yes,  Raffi, I think 9.4 was too high.  Just like when I said it before.

With that said, lets revisit my desire to "disassociate" the athletes with the controversy.  They are my friends, and the worked hard to get where they are (which, I feel they deserved, so please take that into consideration before calling me an evil person) - and I simply didn't want to see their names dragged through the mud.   That is all.

I shouldn't have said anything about the upset, it was unrelated to the rest of my post, but I tried to refer to other parts of the thread.  I was simply trying to go along with the idea that Phil-the-agony said in his [post](http://boards.gamers.com/messages/ message_view.asp?name=raffi&id=zxwit). Maybe they didn't train between trials and worlds, maybe DY simply rocked, maybe they were injured, maybe they had bad Chinese. I am not trying to say all things in July were fair.  I was not trying to rub your face in it.  I was  <b>NOT</b> saying I condone any cheating or other morally despicable actions.

I do not understand how you took my post to mean what you said, or why you decided that I was amoral and generally all around evil.  Let's see: I admitted to understanding your suspensions and even made a joke about Nadir (which I hope he took differently than you did).  Then I tried to stand up for my friends.  And mistakenly (read the above paragraph) tried to tack on the 'upset' part saying "hey, it  <i>could</i> happen."  (When I wrote that all I could think of was "what are the chances that VT could loose to West Virginia and beat Miami")

I knew I should have posted anonymously.  This is depressing and now I am stuck defending my character to the same bunch of people I have stuck up for in the past.

Chris </blockquote>

That is pretty much the end of it, but I am gonna keep a few more for my own edification.

Raffi
<blockquote>But the point is its NOT an upset!

As we've mentioned, this is exactly what we knew and predicted would happen. Its only an upset if you deluded yourself into thinking they were 9.4 level people in the first place.

But again, you can't just say 'can't we all get along?' and try to disassociate yourself from the controversy while simultaneously reaping the rewards from your unfair advantage.

(its akin to saying 'yes, segregation is bad, but please stop mentioning it to me.' as you continue to patronize your all-white southern lunch counter).

Why not help rectify the problem instead of just benefiting from it? </blockquote>

Me
<blockquote>Mr. Openminded:

It is an "upset" if you consider the scores that were received at team trials, instead of your prediction. So on paper it was an "upset." You just defined it differently. </blockquote>
animaljams (to raffi's post)
<blockquote>So I have been reading this website over the past few months since the US team trials. I never had any intention to voice my opinion because I truly felt that people are going to believe what they want to believe and changing one's opinion is most times incredibly difficult if not impossible. I am not even sure what opinion it is I would like to change. What I do know is that, I love wushu. It seems to me that everyone that visits this message board carries the same sentiment. Am I wrong? You all love it too, if not you would not be so passionate in your views. Having passion for something it the greatest gift ever. We are so lucky to be able to participate in something we feel so strongly about. I have only been introduced to the world of wushu for one year. Oh how often I wish I had known as a young person. But that doesn't stop me and I hope that never stops anyone who finds something they love.

It seems so easy to take someone's words and misconstrue them to sound as if they are saying something they are not. Clearly fuzzymonk was sending a positive message regarding the wushu community and how all of the athletes who love the sport should support one another. This actually did happen for some brief moments in July in Virginia. I heard JIA YOU from both coasts even when athletes from opposing coasts were on the floor. I hate to even use the term opposing when referring to athletes representing the same nation. I don't mean to seem idealistic. I do realize in my short time in this community that the past holds strife in regards to the federation. I was not here so I do not pretend to understand the impact this strife had on any athletes. I do know that many people wanted the leader of the federation to be removed. It seems to me that by association a coach from the east coast was dragged into it, which seems to have directly impact her students. It is like a domino. Guilty by association. How extremely closeminded and unfair. I know that we all watch wushu from other countries and commend the athletes that we think are sick. Why is it that we can't do that for our own athletes. It seems to me that we as a community have spent so much energy concentrating on negativity and victimism. What about all the great things that have happened. More participation in the sport, some united love after a great competition. These are the things we should focus on. Positive reinforcement leads to future positive behaviors.

Those from either coast that have spent any time trying to understand the other have seen similar qualities and that same passion in each other. Written words are final. If something is documented and in the future the opportunity arises to develop a relationship or a kinship with a fellow athlete who those words have been directed at then it will be difficult to take those words back.

I am sure SCWA,OMEI,USWA and all other schools, I apologize to not name all, athletes love wushu with the same heart and soul. I am also sure no one is saying that they want issues to continue. I truly hope regardless of scoring that no one believes that the best athletes from the US weren't on the team and currently representing the US in Macau. Of course disregarding Cheri(sp), who made a choice to pursue a wonderful opportunity. Those that did not get the opportunity to compete as a US team member, I hope you are training even harder now for the next opportunity. Seize each as if it is your only one.

In closing I would like to say congratulations to DY who has stepped up to the occasion and clearly put it on the floor. I would also like to congratulate Stephon for his performance in SS and Jessica for her SS as well. The courage of all athletes to compete at a world class level is admirable and to say that you are in the top ten in the world is an incredible honor.

Quote:

'Someone asked me what it would take to convince skeptics of my innocence. I answered, "I don't know." I was beginning to think I would be presumed guilty for the rest of my life.

Everything I had worked so hard for, my career, my reputation, what I'd done as an athlete, everything I had could go away, all the things you lose when people don't think your a good guy.

But there is one thing you can't lose, and that's yourself. I had my own innocence; that was something no one could mess with.'

As I said in my last message, of course those who benefit from an unfair system want people to pipe down, to 'just get along' and not speak negatively, you have nothing to lose and everything to gain by being on the receiving end of an unfair system.

Try being on the other end of that equation and have someone say "oh, its OK, let's be positive! stop complaining about the screw job you got!" would you roll over and give up?

In other words "positivity" doesn't do anything to change the system, the system is flawed and it needs changing (if you don't train at Omei). Being positive just let's it perpetuate for another 2 or 4 years.

Sure, because as I've said, its not a personal issue between individuals. Its about an unfair system that favors some and SCREWS others.

But I heard a lot of disgruntled athletes who spent hundreds of dollars to go to trials, just to watch certain athletes getting absurdly high scores, allowing those people to get a spot on the team they didn't earn.

Not at all. I completely disagree.

You really should look into the reasons for the strife before you talk on this subject maybe. You admit you're knowledge of the past is limited, therefore you should be careful about drawing closeminded and unfair conclusions about things.

LXL isn't an innocent bystander by any means. As a matter of fact, it was her nomination for an IWuF position by Goh against the Board's wishes that was the straw that broke the camels back and led to the WKF Board's vote to remove Goh. (and think about possible reasons why the board didn't nominate her).

After the so-called 'coup', in an attempt to bolster his support Goh placed LXL (and Martha Burr believe it or not!) to Board positions, two of his most loyal supporters. Fortunately for all of us, Goh's own lawyer told him this was illegal, (this doesnt' get mentioned by Emperor Goh very often).

But even before 1999, LXL was caught cheating on behalf of her students. I would point you to the 1997 Nationals incident where LXL was acting as a head judge and conveniently forgot to deduct her star student Clara Shen for being short of time. It caused a big brouhaha ultimately requiring the higher officials to over rule her and force her to follow the rules. (these are facts). She has a long track record of abusing her position to favor her own students.

And since 99? You get the 2001 team trials and the 2003 team trials where LXL's students get absurdly high scores (9.4's!!!!) and then go to worlds and do not achieve anywhere near that score. Anyone who's been paying attention can see this is just BS... US athletes should not be getting a 9.4 no matter who's student they are.

Goh and LXL work hand in hand, one hand washes the other, she is by no means an innocent bystander who's caught up in this. Talk to more people and look at some of the old entries on the news here to get more information about this before you jump to any conclusions.

If nothing she is benefiting from an unfair system just like the Omei students are. Why isn't she demanding more fairness in competitions? Why isn't she recusing herself from these events? Think about it.

- I know that we all watch wushu from
- other countries and commend the athletes that we
- think are sick. Why is it that we can't do that for
- our own athletes. It seems to me that we as a
- community have spent so much energy concentrating on
- negativity and victimism.

Are you sure you're from America? Cause last time I checked we value contrary viewpoints and embrace dissence, rather then persecute it, suppress it or otherwise pretend that its not going on.

It reminds me on an anecdote from a book reading of Iris Chang's book on the "Rape of Nanjing" someone stood up and said "why are you talking about this negative stuff? we should all get along, we don't want non-asians to think we area all bad people who do stuff like this!" (this is the popular 'let's sweep the injustice under the rug so the neighbors don't find out about it). -- easier said then done if you're Chinese.

- What about all the great
- things that have happened. More participation in
- the sport, some united love after a great
- competition. These are the things we should focus
- on. Positive reinforcement leads to future positive
- behaviors.

Yeah, look at all the great advances we had since 2001! oh wait, I don't hardly see any... Good Nationals? nope! Judges training? Nope. Regional Qualifiers? nope! An organized national body? nope! Any others? Let's see.... remember when they forgot to invite US team members who weren't omei students to the so-called "US Team demo" in Salt Lake City? remember when they gave them 1 week's notice on Pan Am games? no you probably don't remember that....

And now after 2003? WKF blew its last chance... lots of people trained REALLY hard for team trials, spent a lot of money and now harbor a LOT of resentment (not because they didn't make it, because they felt like they got shafted despite how they did). They don't want to try another trials, don't want to even do competitive wushu anymore.

This is progress? You haven't been in this sport very long if you don't see a pattern here.

- I truly
- hope regardless of scoring that no one believes that
- the best athletes from the US weren't on the team
- and currently representing the US in Macau. Of

HAVE YOU BEEN PAYING ATTENTION? that's exactly what we are talking about! We all surely DO NOT BELIEVE that the best athletes were on the US Team exactly because of scoring! The friggin' scores prove what we have predicted! DY was last of the 4 people on the A team, yet he is doing HEAD AND SHOULDERS better then the two who were 1 and 2 (I haven't seen all of Jason Liu's results).

If the scoring at trials could be said to be at all fair and that's the way the trials results ended up, then no one could complain, but we have seen in black and white that the scores given to people at trials were not at all correct. The scores that got those people on the team are suspect, therefore their legimacy as 'the best athletes in the US' is ENTIRELY under attack.

- Those that did not
- get the opportunity to compete as a US team member,
- I hope you are training even harder now for the next
- opportunity. Seize each as if it is your only one.

Dude, you are really idealistic, that's great, I don't mean to dissuade your enthusiasm, but look at it from the other side. Let's say you train your ASS OFF for 2 years preparing for what might be your LAST shot for the games, there is no next opportunity. You try your hardest and you find out that all your hard work is worthless because they're handing out 0.2 bonuses to people who's coaches are hosting the trials. Training harder will only get you so far. It was able to get DY on the team, and thats it. What about the Joe Scarcellas, the Phil Dangs, the Mark Musashis, the Brandon Sugiyamas, the Dary Saos?

These people played by the rules, tried their hardest and got screwed over by a system stacked against them from the beginning. Think about that when you tell people to pipe down and stop raining on Stephon and Justin's parade...

-Raffi</blockquote>

Overall it's not that bad, and I do give Raffi credit for making good points -- Marco on the other hand was just trolling and insulting.  Both missed my point, and I understand why, and learned my lesson.  Of course I am sure I have been branded another sean marshall (agh), which on that peticular message board is about as bad as it gets.  BUT, it is still just a message board and I need to realize that it really dosen't matter.  That lance armstrong quote sums up exactly how I feel.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Ok, so Tom and I went to lunch today and were discussing flies*.  I am not completely sure where the topic sprouted, but we were confused by the effectiveness of flyswatters.  When compared to, say, your hand.  They are about the same size, so why do flies always escape from your hand attacks?  Tom theorized that it was because you swing the flyswatter faster because you are not afraid of hurting your hand.  I thought maybe it was harder for the fly to see the swatter.  Needless to say we are in awe of the swatter.  That only applies to the "smart" flies.  As Tom pointed out there are some types of flies (normally the ones that repeatedly bang head first into glass) that you can kill with you hand, heck you can kill them with a simple flick, but those are of little more than entertainment value.

So Tom proposed the theory of <i>Fly vs. Human brain size</i>:  If a fly has the brainpower it takes to fly around, stick to walls, find food, avoid hand attacks and everything else a fly needs to do -- yet it's brain the size of a pin head, what the hell is wrong with our big ole brains.  Is the processing power of a brain proportional to size?  We basically assumed yes, and then wanted to know why we are wasting our brain. Yeah, yeah, we all know that <i>humans only use 10% of our brains</i>, but our brains are at least a bazillion times bigger than a fly's -- and if you go with the assumption that flies use 100% of their brain then we are like ...1 bazillion / 10 ... Carry the 1 ... lots smarter.

Of course, ultimately this led nowhere, but in the mean time we came up with a few possible explanations for <i>Tom's 1st theory of flies</i>.  My favorite is that perhaps they cannot store memories in their brains at all, thus freeing up all the entire brain for processing proposes.  This has the added bonus of everything being exciting and new ("oh, wow, this stuff is great, what is it?  Poo you say?  I think I will hang here for a while"), like that blue fish from Finding Nemo.  Perhaps everything is hardwired in a fly's brain so it needs <b>much</b> less hardware.  Of maybe we humans are just so lazy that we only use one bazillionth of are brain, and if we a fly grows a big brain like us it will take over the world.

*I realize that now I have written two entries about flies, let me assure you that I have very little interest in this topic unless they are A) invading my bedroom, or B) Tom brings up the topic at Wendy's.  Mmmm, Magic Mountain Spicy Chicken Sandmich.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[We skipped gymnastics last night in lieu of Paula's Thursday departure. We got everyone to sign the collage frame, and gave it to her at the end of class.    Class was pretty typical, I tried me some iron man wushu and did both sword and broadsword.  My forearm got so tired I could not get my b-sword to make any snap at all.  It was a good burn.

Recently (well, last month or so) I have imposed a new rule upon my wife:  She cannot go away with out me for more than zero days.  She has broken the rule a number of times since then. Good thing for her it doesn't bear any sort of punishment or reprimand other than me dancing around demanding that she stay.  I am beginning to think that my method of enforcing the rules I make up is flawed.  I will have to rethink that - because recently Kelly informed me that she will be gone extra for the next couple of weeks.  If this keeps up I am gonna relapse into my college diet of tuna and Oreos.

Gonna go find lobster with Paula et. al. tonight, so I will sneak over to wushu for some taiji fun and then go play with the wife right when she gets home.  Which sure beats the hell out of leaving for 2 hours of wushu 3, maybe 4, minutes after she returns from her Richmond trip. Bachelor day is way overrated, especially if you are like me and depend on the wife for all sustenance.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Paula can eat.  I am thinking she can out eat Tom the Tiger.  We went to the poor man's nice restaurant because she wanted a 3 pound lobster.  Well, that particular red lobster has a very sad lobster tank, and it only contained small sickly lobsters.  So she at least refrained from getting a whole lobster, and opted for the <i>Ultimate feast</i> (Maine Lobster, king crap, shrimp, mashed potatoes, etc).  But eating that alone was nto impressive, she was downed 4 or 5 cheesy garlic briskets, a few stuffed mushrooms, finished Jason's steak, and about half of Kelly's shrimp feast.  Oh, don't for get the 2.5 bowls of ice cream at the end.  That girl is a machine. We took a few pictures, but it was sad that she was leaving.  Hopefully she will be back soon. Wushu just isn't the same when we are missing 1/2 the people (come back Lucas, Sarah, Emily, Paula, &#91;and every other day&#93; Stephan/Bee).

We are facing a winter advisers, so our trip to Richmond this weekend may be in peril. I really wanna go, not so much to the party (well, aside form the free drinks) but there is a nice hotel and I would like to track down Jason and possibly some of the other Grove-ites. Lets just wait and see if the weather insists on being fractious. C'mon rain, c'mon snow -- boo sleet!

We waited an hour in the beer isle at Safeway today during lunch for a flu shot.  There was plenty of standing in the cold induced delirious talk.  Things crossed the line a number of times, it resulted in an entertaining wait in line (the best $5 I ever spent[!](http://www.homestarrunner.com/sbemail89.html)).

Spear tonight.  I got to go now and do something completely unrelated to me throwing together the aforementioned local news.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<b>Snow, a Corporate Christmas party and My Birthday.</b>

The weekend started off the same as last weekend, with a long drive to Richmond.  The traffic was not quite as bad, but it was still there.  Only this time it was weather induced. We put all sorts of time and effort in planning around the weather as it was supposed to snow and sleet and freezing rain resulting in a complete shutdown of the east coast.  Luckily it never did anything more than rain in Richmond, and even NOVA never got hit hard by the snow.  By Saturday it has cleared up in DC so we were able to drive back late Saturday night.

And in the mean time we were able to hit up a big party for Kelly's Company.  Pretty typical of a well-off company throwing a big party at a hotel, clearly the highlight was the nice hotel they put us up at.  I entertained my self pretty good as everyone else rambled on and on about so-and-so and what's her face (<i>the ugly one!</i>).  Plus Kelly got the hook-up and we were able to score all the drink tickets we wanted.  Too bad we didn't win the iPod door prize.

Most fun was hanging with people on Saturday.  Chilled with my parents, hung out with Jason and reeked havoc over at my sister's place.  My nephew was the highlight of the weekend.  That boy is great fun.  When we showed up at Laura's house Jacob was still sleeping.  Eventually we heard Jacob fussing, but when matt got up to go get him Kelly offered to send me.  So I poked my head in and asked him what was going on.  He didn't really gasp, but he sure had this stunned look on his face.  Immediately he jumped out of bed and said that he needed to take off his pull-ups and put on big boy underwear.  So we did that.  I even helped him into pants.

Once that was finished he wanted to go downstairs and do <i>Chris moves</i>.  I think we were able to keep him in the living room for a few minutes distracting him with taking off my shoes and putting on his shoes.  But inevitably we headed down and popped in the PDP DVD for some <i>Chris moves</i>. I didn't realize that the Peking Duck movies were like the Rocky Horror Picture Show for toddlers, it's interactive, whenever something happens in the movie you are supposed to act it out at home.  If I et knocked down, you are supposed to lie down; if I am running, your supposed to be running; if I am fighting you are supposed to be fighting.  It was very entertaining to watch Jacob watch movie after movie, he knew what to do every time.  During Transfer Complete we ran down stairs, typed on the computer, got stuffed in a trunk and broke free (well, we hit under pillows on the couch), and punched and kicked like crazy.  It took me a long time to figure out what he was doing when he would look up and jump - but it turns out that it was when I run into the dead end at the school and I unsuccessfully try to jump up and grab the roof.

Jacob is great fun, and of course I love it that he thinks I am so great.  The only problem is living up to his expectations. Ok, the other problem is the potty training - only this problem is not as bothersome.  However I did get to learn that (and I quote) that "I &#91;Jacob&#93; don't like to pee on my leg" and "Sometimes I poot when I pee."  And right after he told me that last one he ripped a good stinky one.  Then he laughed really hard.  I laughed too, then I wanted to leave the room.  'Cause that was smelly.

Jacob rocks.  Joshua too, but he is much more sedate.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I raked in the loot:  a new phone, a sweet winter coat, fun electric razor, and the best belt ever.  Gotta give everyone a proper punch in the belly to thank them.  Plus I recieved more phone calls to wish me a happy day than I have ever recieved before.  Super fun.

And now a joke:<blockquote>x and e^x are walking down the street. They encounter d/dx, who operates on them. x disappears. e^x survives, thanking the math gods that he is immune to differential operators. While walking on, he encounters another operator coming toward him. "Who are you?" he asks. "I'm d/dy," the operator answers. </blockquote>

Shuddup, I never said I wasn't a [geek](http://science.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/12/05/1729215&mode=thread&tid=133&tid=186).
<blockquote> A neutron walks into a bar and asks "how much for a beer?" The bartender replies "for you, no charge."</blockquote>Yeah yeah, I know.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I finally finished spear last night, and I even did an entire section.  Very poorly.  I just learned section 4, and despite the fact that I have practiced a number of the movements from that section before I still really stank up the place.  Learning new stuff is fun, but it is also fun to be good at something and work on refining it.  The awkwardness of spear makes me want to go back to staff.  Sword never felt as good as staff.  But spear is so cool.  It also makes me wanna throw up.  It is the hardest (read: most exhausting) weapon I have ever tried.

At one point in class it dawned on me that I was a decade older than everyone there.  Aiya.  We have one of 2 very serious problems: 1) The older advanced peeps are slacking off and needa return to train or 2) I am too old for this and needa slack off with the others.

<i>Two more years</i>.

On a sucky note: Shopping sucks.  So do other work intensive obligations<!--Stupid wedding video-->.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Shout out to all da homez: Stephan, Jason, Kevin, Amina, Tom (the tiger), Paulo, Bryan, Dmitry, Josh, Glenn, Danny, Jeannie, Sean and especially Kelly for making the piznarty funzzle for shizzle.  Word.

Ok, ok.  Saturday we had a little gathering based around the concept that Glenn and I are birthday twins.  Amina was off just a little, but honestly her birthday twin in much hotter than mine (sorry Glenn).  A few people skipped out pretty early because of the impending snow, but the remaining few had a crazy fun time.  I gave my self the award for the best 3-man rule of the night <i>Categories</i>: if you roll an 8 (or some other trigger) the roller has to say a category, going clockwise everyone names something in the category.  You have 5 seconds to answer.  Hilarity ensues.

Idee fixe. Friday class was missing something.  My first clue was when I pulled my hamstring.  As I was rubbing <i>red flower ointment</i> (Chinese ben-gay) on the back of my leg I realized that advanced class had been bereft of stretching.  Yep, we just stared out with running drills and is progressed into basics.  It wasn't bad till we transitioned from the jogging-esque drills to kick-punch.  Kick punch has always been a scary one for me, form some reason I tend to shred things then.  We must do that basic too soon in the cycle these days.  Basics order is strange, I have been to a few wushu guans and they all seem to do things drastically different orders.  There has got too be an optimal way.  I'll have to get Kelly and Jeannie to analyze that one.  ISE's to the rescue!]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I wanted to train at noon today, but class starts at 11, and it is 11:06 now, so that is nto gonna happen. Crap.  That woulda been a good day.  Lift on the morning, train for a hour at noon. Chiptole for dinner.  And a hour or two of training tonight.  But it's going to work out that way.  I'll still train tonight.  Kelly, Jeannie and Danny getta go to the movie, and I go to wushu.  Of course I 'could' go, but I opted to see <i>Return of the King</i> at Midnight with workers.

Training last night was abbreviated.  With out the warmup and basics long weapon class is easy, especially if you don't' really know the form yet.  I was glad I made it there because Sara was able to help me out on spear.  Damn that weapon awkward and hard to learn.  The other crappy part of spear is I am stuck on the compulsory until I get it good.  I cannot come up with an optional until I have learned some proper spear flavor.  But once I do, I am going to study them tapes I brought back form china like they are holy scripture.  I know the compulsories are created-by-committee pablum, but it's a good place to start.  No, not really, but for some reason I have a monstrous geek attraction to standards.  Horrid nasty appalling standards.

<hr />

Oh, I found out I am allergic to Tilex.  If I am exposed to Tilex I will sneeze like crazy all the while producing copious amounts of runny flem.   Sure, my methods may be flawed.  'Cause I was half way through the shower and thought it would be nicer to shower in a clean tub.  So I threw the curtain back and jumped out, naked and dripping wet, even a little soapy to dig under the sink for the cleaning supplies.  I grabbed the bucket with the brushes, scrubber pads and the spray bottle of Tilex.  It was chilly outside of the hot water.  So once I was comfortably back under the streaming warmness I commenced spraying, scrubbing and sneezing.  I in addition to the tub and the tile on the walls, I scrubbed the shower curtain and even disassembled the shower caddy and cleaned that with astonishing attention to detail -- a the while a fun stream of flem pouring out of my nose.  It was about that time that I examined the back of the Tilex spray bottle.  It warned me to avoid breathing the mist and to prevent exposure to bare skin.  Luckily I was not wearing any clothes.  I had a difficult time getting to sleep, apparently once you get out of the shower and away from the lingering clouds of Tilex you don't just clear back up, you get all stuffed up.  Just in case that was not enough to remind me of my bathroom adventure I must have continued to sneeze for a good 18 hours.

Sneezes are the most fun if you provoke them, and right when they are coming out you try to hold them in.  Your sure to make a mess that-a-way. Normally a mess on your computer monitor.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Solaris hates me.  OK, so I was stupid and screwed it up proper, and should be formally repremanded for my horrid unix blunders.  But I fixed that. Now I am having a hell of a time getting the stuffed that worked before to work again.  It is just diffrent enough from linux that it throws me off.  At least the bsd in darwin was polite.  I want to punch that loud-ass server right in the DNS.

I took a LONG lunch today, it consisted of traing at 11, and meeting both work friends and normal friend+wife. But don't worry, I am getting punished by the Sun of the devil.  Sneaky server.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[A lot of fun stuff happened.  It was Christmas fun so; I guess that should be expected.  We went and played the family hopping games.  Starting off for Richmond and Christmas Eve with Grandma and all the Longs.  And a quick chaser of Waldorf.  Kelly clearly wanted to relax and chill in the 'dorf for a while, but I was going into work on the 26th. Which really wasn't bad, I had Glenn come out and meet Kelly and I for lunch.  He was supposed to take us out for Pho, but the place was closed so we went across the parking lot to Chili's. The crazy thing was Kelly actually wanted the Pho.  Normally she simply tolerates it for me, not that she doesn't like it ' more like she doesn't want it.  But she did on Friday.  Perhaps it is because she wasn't feeling so great.

After returning home from our adventurous trips we spent most of the time cleaning and relaxing.  And by relaxing I mean playing SSX -- and playing with our other presents.  Kelly went and put on her new clothes and I played with my toys.  I had fun figuring out my Diabolo (learned some fun new tricks from the web between bouts of hitting the sun server with a stick while at work, and returned home to try them out).

The most memorable of the Christmas adventures would be my Father in law's fault.  In an attempt to off me while making it look like an accident -- he gave me a unicycle.  The first day all I did was figure out how to mount that bastard.  Which pretty much consists of stomping on a pedal and ramming a seat and post up your backside.  A very <i>odd</i> sensation. I would try to scoot around but couldn't find a good place to learn.  A few other times I would get on it in the house but no progress was made at all.  So yesterday we went to Falls Church high school and pedaled around the basketball courts.  I stayed upright the entire time, mostly by the aid of my dutiful wife. The most I rode unassisted was maybe 5 yards, normally I would freak out after a yard and bail.  But with Kelly's help I was able to make a few laps around the courts.  Now you must understand this was not a smooth easy pedal like when you learn to ride a bicycle, rather I would hold onto Kelly's shoulder or back of her neck and push and shoved her around while trying to keep the unicycle under me.  She would lurch and gag as she walked next to me and cheer me on.  Sean showed and we had some fun watching him impale himself with the cycle.  I even attempted a frontal lobotomy on the metal bleachers.  Overall I'd say it was a productive day.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<b>Xin Nian Kuai Le</b>

Ok, so much has happened in the last week, and I distinctly remember thinking of some wonderful insightful topics to expand upon, but for the most part I don't' remember any of those.  So I will give a nice polite "here's what I did" for posterity's sake.

Oh, one mildly insightful thought I had was during a drive out to D-n-J's place.  Basically I was trying to figure out why bicycles never caught on the US, and I came to the conclusion that is was because we had A) too many horses, and B) too much money.  I figured that by the time that horses were being phased out for good that the US had come into the money, so mix that with a dash of cheap cars and we were good to go.  I never said it was a good thought, or even original, but I came to the conclusion all on my own, and I was pretty damn happy with myself. For like seconds.

Recap.

Wushu has been uneventful for the past few classes, the biggest thing there is demo practice for a Chinese new years demo we are prepping for.  It's got fun fighting sets, but that is mostly the same set that Stephan and I did for that last demo.  However, it still rocks hardcore.

New years day I was scrambling to try and scrape up a few people for the festivities.  All the wushu people bailed.  Even Sean was not gonna come, he had been tricked onto some other activity.  So for a while it was just gonna be Me, Kelly and Danny.  Luckily I was able to chase down Dmitry, and Josh -- and eventually Sean did show up.  Kelly was even able to get her bro and his woman to drop in.  It turned into a night of fun games and excess poculation. Everything went well, save for Kelly's repeated self injuries.  And to give her credit, most of the self-inflected injuries occurred over the rest of the week, and involved no intoxication at all. Poor girl.

New years day was spent wishing I had never hear of Korbel or any of it's products.

When Saturday rolled around I was able to drag Tom and Danny up for some skiing.  It was sorta like skiing on a slurpee.  The puddles kept getting bigger, the trails got muddier and we had lots of fun.  Nearly the entire day was spent on the terrain park.  As soon as we discovered its existence we never did another trial. I did some jumps, Tom mastered his grinding skills and Danny straddled a rail.  The little skis were fun, and the worst part of the day was discovering the big gauges in the bottom of them.  And for skiing, there are much worse things that coulda happened.

Sunday I was back at Chinese school.  Chipotle. Then football. Mmmm, chipotle.

Hold on, I gotta go find a burrito...]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Xeno's Paradox is fun:<blockquote>" ... If you travelling from point A to point B, you necessarily must travel half of the distance to point B before travelling all of the distance. Now from that point you must again travel half of the remaining distance. If you continue to do so (travel half of the distance) you will never reach point B. I think this paradox is at the crux of the mysterious digital/analog relationship, but it is a strong argument that reality is digital, meaning that it has a smallest unit. This is because one DOES get to point B, thus at some point we must pass an "unhalvable" point." ([wikipedia](http://www.metaweb.com/wiki/wiki.phtml?title=Einstein%27s_Principle_of_Equivalence)) </blockquote>[Einstein thought so too](http://www.metaweb.com/wiki/wiki.phtml?title=Einstein%27s_Principle_of_Equivalence), which only adds to the funination.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I slept for a total of 18 hours last night.  Not exactly the most fun way to spend a friday night, but I think I was tired and needed the sleep.  So much for wushu.  I was out before 7 anyway.

I must say I do like the feeling of waking up completely rested, even if it is combined with the lingering feeling that you haven't moved for a <b>very</b> long time.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[As you can see I have acted on my paranoia.  Sorry, for making people login to see this, but in all honesty the people that really want to read this stuff already has an account on the pdp board. And hopefully this will weed out the people that may just stumble across things or are doing research on me and don't want me to know.  Sure, I could always just watch my logs, but that was hardly a deterrent.  So hopefully this project will get back on the right path, which was never supposed to be "this is what I did today" blogging.

Plus now I can use people's names, because in 15 years when I come back and read this I may not remember who 'J' was.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I know the hits to the log have gone way up, and it was really cool knowing that you had a reader base - and that would inspire me to write more often, but honestly, that is nto the kinda writing I want to be doing.  Yeah yeah yeah, that's what I said last time.

So, lets learn a fun new word:
<b>tergiversation</b> \tuhr-jiv-uhr-SAY-shuhn\, <i>noun</i>:
1. The act of practicing evasion or of being deliberately ambiguous.
2. The act of abandoning a party or cause.

Now that's fun wordin'

<hr />

I have been a little introspective as of late.  Not exactly sure why, but I know it has something to do with buying a house.  I have more fear of commitment over this house than I ever did over getting married.  Before the wedding I was cool, never a negative thought.  The only regret I have is not getting a better DJ for the reception.  And of all the things to go wrong, that is a pretty minor one.

Buying the house is not the problem, I know I am behind the learning curve on the financial knowledge - but I have Kelly who has the d/l on debt (via her job, not personal experience).  Plus she has gone through a couple of books on the subject.  It's not that I don't want to learn me some mortgagein', more that I don't want to commit to a life of cubical living.  Kelly <b>really</b> wants to have kids.  And I do too.  Don't get me wrong, the only thing holding me back from reproducing is my last ditch attempt at a good career.  Or at least what I would consider a good career.

Cause if you ask anyone else about my current career path they'll say it's  a "good" one.  But it is also those people that led me down the path through school, to this job, in a cube, under florescent lights that suck your soul from your body.  Behind a CRT that is one day going to make me sprout a third eye that can squirt a vial liquid from.

I don't want a third eye.

Perhaps this is just an early midlife crisis.  Everyone in a while I start fretting over my status among my coworkers.  Who has what title, who is making more money - only to realize that I am actually fretting about details that make absolutely no difference to anyone.

Of course cirque teasing me didn't help.  When I imagine what life coulda been like I see this wonderful exciting world.  But then I think about programming till I lack the physical competence to run up a wall and do a flip and I get this feeling in my chest, a feeling like my lungs have collapsed.

Now that I reread this, I think it is depressing, and that is will shine a negative light on my personal life.  Just remember that is it related to my professional life only.

If you want depressing, lets talk about lifting.  I have only been once since the near year (two weeks) and I lost my little index card that I record the weight I lift.  Now that is sad. I am also gonna have a hard time getting up tomorrow to remedy this melancholy state because I have wushu and gymnastics tonight.  Bryan said he is going, so I really wanna go too (I haven't seen him in a while).  Hopefully this gymnastics will be more productive than it was last Tuesday, where I did 30 min of aerial twists into the pit then stopped.  I will do some real tumbling, and I need to run up that post a few more times if I am ever gonna get that wall flip where I am comfortable with it.

Ok, I am off to work on the Wushu Score DB thing that no one will maintain unless it is yours truly...dah.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[House Shopping.

I think about houses all day, worry about mortgages all night and we drove around looking last night.  We looked at one in Fairfax and a few in Centerville.  The Fairfax one, at a mere $300K was ugly as sin.  Awesome location, nasty price for a ugly house.  Just think of a townhouse built in the early 70s in a development intended to imitate the nice southwestern stucco style nestled in the woods of VA.  It wasn't even a nice looking stucco and tile building, it was just ugly.

There were 2 in Centerville that I would actually consider, but they are so far away from everything.  Well, everything 'cept Jeannie.  Which would really make up for a lot, but, she may be moving in a year and that location would el sucko.

I wanna ago drive and look at the places in burke.  Burke is really my first choice, unless something pops up inside the beltway -- but I don't think that will happen in our price range.

Wushu:  Skipped Wednesday for work happy hour (fun with beer and wings), skipped Thursday for house shopping, I may skip tonight (polly not) -- but we got this big demo next weekend so I will log 6 hours of training on Saturday.  I figure once I let coach in on the fact that I am looking for a house she'll be cool.  Of course it is hard for me to improve if I am not training.  At least I have been lifting.

Need...food...now...]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Well, house hunting involves making more choices than I would like to ever think about.  Of course if I didn't have the opportunity to make these choices I would be bitter that I lacked the options I want.   Mostly I am referring to the mortgage options, but you cannot over look the bigger choices.  Of course when we go around form house to house are basically happy with 75% of them.  By far the most fun part of this shopping process is going into the horrible, horrible houses.  Some of these people what two hundred and sixty thousand dollars for a split level town house or an ingenious floor plan that consists of 49% stairs.  That place had a lot of stairs.

Oh, if they are offering a thousand dollar allowance for new carpeting the existing carpet is going to be really nasty.

And then there was the perfect house.  For a mere three hundred grand we could have had the perfect townhouse in Burke.  The biggest problem is that we expect the house to go for more than that.  It was a little 3 bedroom brick townhouse.  The lady that lived there had been there for a good 20 years -- all hardwood floors (including a special hardwood floor in the basement that is guaranteed not to warp). new kitchen, extra cabinets, hot tub under the back deck,  ya-know, the works.  It just felt too much

Wushu on Saturday was long.  And hurty.  After checking out the open house for the perfect house I went off to class.  I set off with the specific intent to be late to class.  O-Mei's infamous punctuality proved it self once again.  Turns our that 15 or 20 minutes is not enough to be late, instead I had to sit around for 5 minutes.  Even then they played the circle game (quite possible the worst way to warm up), I opted to run around the room instead. Coach called our warm up short.  I pulled my left hamstring.  So I took it easy on that.  I hurt my left hip.  I then iced my hammy during the hour between the afternoon practice till the time I had to leave for the rehearsal practice in Gaithersburg.  During which my hip was killing me.  It was pretty miserable.  And the best part was coach assured me that it would only be an hour. Aaron and I decided that when coach says once, we should hear ten times.  That way when we stop after 7 we are so happy to be done early.

Eventually we got to go home, on nice slick sleet covered roads.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I was really glad to make it out to gymnastics last night.  I had quite the head ache when Sean showed up to give me a ride, but by the end of gymnastics I had a second wind.  The best part was the trampoline has a new bed on it -- so no more fear of punching through that told worn out one any more.  The new one, while it is white, is really nice.  Not quite as bouncy as the old one, but it sure is softer.

I did work on round off back flips.  I never really got any round off back tucks like I wanted, but I was consistent with the round off whip back.  I really need to make a solid point of drilling gymnastics tumbling when I am at gymnastics.  I still have plenty of time to play around and have fun, but recently there have been weeks that I haven't done any proper tumbling.  I will loose what skills I have recently learned unless I can keep it up.

Oh, all that gymnastics followed a total lack of Wushu.  I just flat out skipped.  And Kelly wasn't even home to enjoy it.  I did how ever go shopping after work and grab some kebobs before going home.  With the horrible traffic on the beltway that trip home took near an hour.  Accident on the off ramp for 50, they completely closed down my exit. So I have to continue down and head back up just to get home.  By that time it was 10 till 7, so I just ate my kebobs and played Starcraft.

I really dig having a laptop from work, the only problem is the "Q" key is intermittent.  In fact I am surprised it works there.  Earlier in this post when I wrote "quite" I have to type "uite" and use Word's spell check to get he "Q" added on.  Hmmm, right now it seems that the uppercase one works...wait no, it only works if you press <shift>+Q, if you just press Q (caps lock or not) it wont work.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[We didn't ge the house we bid on.  It went for over $300K.  But when we heard they had 14 bids we sorta figured it was a lost cause.  So sad, that place was super-great.

So the snow came down last night.  We decided that I would just take Kelly to work and she would get a rental car for the trip to Richmond.  So I shoveled off the jeep and Kelly searched for my badge.  Well, she never found my badge, but we were able to get her to work with out incident.  On the way to my office form hers I was getting off the beltway onto 66 and the car in front of me lost control and fishtailed his way into the guard rail.  I was able to coast to a nice stop as much out of the way as I could for the rest of the traffic.  While we (the other helpful guy who pulled over to help) were checking on the first accident a second car went sliding sideways into the end of the guard rail.  This cab hit the guard rail on his rear passenger side wheel.  The man got out, took a look at the damage, jumped back into car and head up our way.  In bewilderment the 3 of us stood there on the side of the road and watched as the drove by.  The lady in the back of the car (yes, he had a customer in the car) just looked at me with this help-this-man-is-nuts look.  Before I realized that my mouth was gaping open I notice that his back wheel was leaning in with a nice 30 degree angle.

We decided we didn't want to be standing on this freeway ramp.  The other helpful guy moved his car up the ramp to a safer spot.  The first accident was able to get his car running, and because he hit the rail head on he just had bent up his bumper and hood.  The radiator wasn't leaking, so he was able to get his car turned around and up off the ramp.  He assured us he had a phone, so we went off to work.

Work involved no interaction with a live person at all.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I know it has been a while, but, man, things have been stressful.  Not really bad at all, but stressful.  The actual work at work is fine, but other more administrative processes are a bit taxing.  Yeah, we had our reviews, but that wasn't bad at all, in fact it was really good - but the really good part of it wasn't until after I had the review.  I flipped out a bit before hand because I have had a couple of jobs that seemed to be going great and suddenly take a sharp downward turn and I get laid off.  Not that any of it had ever been around "review time", but it always involved a sit down one-on-one meeting with management, like, say a review.  Turns out they still love me and provided a proper "attaboy" so I am happy.  The real stress is the <i>other</i> administrative process - but I am not going to go into details about that other than to say most people have a fight, flight or freeze response to immanent peril, well, I have a fight, flight, freeze or faint reaction.

Of course this is not including the task of founding a house.  The market here is absolutely ridiculous.  There is no reason that these places should be going this fast.  Just one day on the market for some.  ONE DAY!  Honestly we get about 10 minutes to decide. You getta walk around and then say yes or no.  Beej has been awesome in making me feel better, as well as dealing with Kelly and I, who have had 2 false starts this week. We said we were gonna put bids in on 2 places and backed out at the last minute.  It just feels so competitive that we feel like we <i>must go win a bid, or we are loosers</i>.  Not pressure.

We will find the perfict house for us for the next few years.  Kelly will have a baking business, and I will run a MA school.  We will have mini-sextons running around, and Jacob will get a new chris-moves DVD.  Life will be good.  All our dreams will come true.

Ya know, thinking about it, our dreams are not that hard to achieve - but they are gonna be so much crazy fun.

On a side note Dirk's dog, AJ, is awesome.  I want a cocker spaniel now. Hunting dogs are the best.

Wushu has been a bust.  Not fully recovered form being sick, my body worn out from stress.  I went on Friday, and it was the worst workout in a long time. I had no endurance at all.  Technique was all off, and I had no desire to push my self.  I need a wushu muse.

I also feel bad for not doing that demo at lake forest mall for coach.  House shopping.

I am going to go eat my yogurt.  I had quite the whammy this morning.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Wushu is canceled ' I didn't go yesterday because my left hammie still hurts form a combination of wushu on Tuesday and running with Kelly on Wednesday.  I also didn't go because I was emotionally and mentally drained from work stuff.

Oh, I also gave myself a fat lip.  I opened my car door into my face.  It hurt.  I felt really stupid.   But that is to be expected if you hit your self in the face with your car door.

Perhaps I will go to wushu tonight and train on my own for a little while.  Jason showed interest in working out earlier.  That seems like a good idea, methinks.

More house hunting this weekend, but I feel as if we have moved past the most depressing part of that and things will get better.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Ok, it has gotten to the point that I am waiting for the real estate agent to call me back and say weather or not we have gotten the house.  I really hope we do, but even so I am nervous about it because we have had to do things like drop the appraisal clause, and add an escalation clause.  All these things make me uneasy.  I just want to offer what they are asking and actually get it.  I long for a market where you can offer less than asking.  Of course, if I am forced to buy in the market I pray to God that nothing happens to it when I wanna sell.  That would only be fair.

I think the stress of this house buying as well as work stuff (especially that "administrative" rigmarole) is really taking a toll on me. My skin has been breaking out, and I think I am getting sick again.  I started to feel phlegmy last night and I think I am actually coming down with something today.  Such a headache.  So tired.  So many hours of wushu to survive through still.

In fact I am at O-Mei now, and Chad--the man--is running class for me.  I would probably bail on everyone if I thought there would be someone to lock up.  Because, really I am not gonna be much use like this.  Time to see what it would be like owning a school <b>and</b> being feverous. <i>Would someone answer that damn phone?!</i>

Oh, the ringing is in my head.  No wonder it hurts so bad.

Some other stuff happened that I really wanted to write about, and it probably pertains to our visit to Todd's new house, or dinner with Jeannie, or maybe dinner with out Jeannie, but I am at a loss for words right now so that will getta wait for, um, probably, ever.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I actually had a really good class today at wushu.  justin was running everything and we all got through direction on the correct technique, which I think was really good for the kids.  So often we train with out any sort of direction other than "go faster", so that was a nice change of pace.

He also made us do tornado split, which none of us had done in a long time, stephan hadn't done it since worlds, I was tornado split free since team trials.  I bruised my heel a little, but nothing bad, especially not bad enough to keep me from trying it half a dozen times.  Surprisingly it was pretty good, or at least if felt that way.  I still didn't kick out and land in a proper split, but I would go down right ways and just sorta push my back leg out that last little bit after I landed.

We are getting ready for a fun dinner at Ruth's Chris -- Jeannie up and dissed us we are meeting up the the Tulli.  And I know everyone's initial reaction to the news that we are having valentines dinner with the in-laws, but actually it is gonna be fun, they make great dinner company.  Plus, it's really good steak.

Time to get wet, naked and soapy (not necessarily in that order).]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I wanted to get to some deeper and more meaningful insights to the workings of my mind, but I went to gymnastics last night and did a ton of aerial twists so that is a better topic.  Stephan came with me and his observations made a huge difference.  Not that I am actually ready to bust one out on the floor, but it is technically better.  In fact, the old way with the extra slant and the pike was much easier to land on the floor, but this way looks right.  Of course as it stands I will need to do it off a 2' ledge in order to have the time to twist <b>and</b> get my feet down.

The trick that Stephan enlightened me to was to keep my chest up and to keep my shoulders/hips square to the direction that I am going instead of the quarter turn in a normal aerial set.  With these tidbits I was keeping my body much straighter and the rotation was nice and clean.

Sometimes I think I over think this stuff.

Coach came back and gave us the d/l on the new rules, and it looks like there is some sorta fuss over the difficulty in the new rules, and since all the other non-Asian countries don't want the difficulty in the routines they are just wanna score the B-Level moves with the exact same value as the C-Level ones.  I am not sure if this is official, but it is at least what bulk of the debate was over there.  I am all about the new rules, optional are where it is at, compulsory routines should be put out of their misery.  The people who want to reduce the difficulty because they can't do it need to train more. Seriously, if you can do a double twist you deserve to get the score of one, not the same score as a single twist.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I actually had a very strange experience at wushu last night.  One of the kids there came to me for advice.  Apparently he caught some kids drinking at school and told on them, so now they want to beat him up.   It totally caught me off guard.  I didn't know what to say, he said these bullies were big kids, which have a history of beating up other kids as well as hauling contraband to school.  One interesting side to the story was that some other kids (referred to as "the girls") were also being threatened, because they also told.

I totally stumbled and didn't know what to say, but I think if I had to do it again, I would advise him to stand up for himself, and especially for the girls.  But never ever do it on their terms - i.e. don't <i>meet 'em in the boys room</i> or <i>under the bleachers</i>, but instead if they attack fight back.  Fight back as hard as possible.

Turning the other cheek only works if you have the power to annihilate the aggressor, I don't think that practice was ever intended to be a proper response to school yard bullies.

Of course I can't verbalize it very well, nor is it original ideas.  This is all stuff I have inherited from my father, and more recently been reaffirmed by John Eldredge.

Still, it is strange to be in a position that the kids approach me and ask my advice.  What have I ever done that impresses upon them that I am a person who might know the answers to their dilemmas.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[We lost another house.  This totally sucks.  I also got an email from Kelly that pretty much summarizes exactly how I feel.
<blockquote>I was just talking to my mom and mentally snapped when she said, "Well, I guess this one just wasn't meant to be."  I am so tired of hearing that!  I told her I think that idealistic bull shit and that I don't think we're loosing these offers because there is a perfect house out there waiting for us, but rather because we're competing against more determined and moneyed seekers.  Any of the places we've looked at would have been great for us, and it's just a freaking townhouse, it's not like there aren't 100's just like each one we look at.

But now I am seriously concerned that we've completely missed the boat.  Since we didn't buy last year or the year before we may now be at a point that we cannot afford what suits our lifestyle (size and location) and no amount of waiting for the market to slow down will ever catch up to that.  We may just have to rent forever until we move away from this area.  And I don't think I'm being melodramatic.

It just makes me so mad that &#91;other people&#93; can have a place and we can't!!!  We're so much more responsible and have much more to put towards this than they do.  But I feel like if we're ever going to make this happen up here we'll have to do what they did and just take money from grandparents or other family with no ability to ever pay it back.  And I just won't do that!  It was hard enough to ask my dad for help.  And we're going to pay that back!

But beyond that, it seems like we have to be ridiculous and completely unsafe in our manner of buying the house if we ever want to make it to the top of the pile.  What can we do when people are coming in with no contingencies??  No offer we can make will ever outweigh that.  Even if we had lots of money to be able to offer a lot more, we can't do that unless the house appraises for that value and that requires a contingency which just knocks us out of the running.

I am so fed up with this!  But I won't consider moving to Richmond - that will be a victory for everyone else and a compromise too great for both of us.  Why is this so hard???  I just don't understand.  We both feel like we're being led to stay in this area so why isn't it working out for us to be able to do that without just throwing our money away?

I just don't know what to say anymore.  I guess I should stop typing because I'm getting nowhere and I need to go see my reading buddy in a couple of minutes.  I just had to get it out.  I want to scream and to stop being pushed to tears.
</blockquote>
I'd add something, but it would only be the same thing that my wife wrote.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[We just finished our home inspection.  Everything was great; the inspector said that it looked like a solid and sturdy house.  Was even impressed that we had all these 'don't do it like that anymore' features -- such as a full brick exterior and a solid cinderblock party wall between units.  Most of the issues that he noted were little things like loose outlets and using braided steel hoses for the washing machine.  We even got to meet our next door neighbor who seemed nice enough.  Can't remember his name, but his dog's name is Molly.

Needless to say I am getting properly excited; we are going to finalize the mortgage today (our rates even dropped from January when we first ran the numbers).  Too bad we gotta wait so long to actually move in.  Of course, it poses no problem, because this way we don't have to break our lease.  But you know how it is, you get so excited when you get the new shoes you just <i>have</i> to wear them out of the store.
<hr />
Tuesday night was fun, we went to gymnastics with a bunch of wushu people, including our favorite Brazilian women.  Jason and Paula hung around and helped Stephan and I work on aerial twists, which are actually improving now.  For the longest time they seemed way off, but after Stephan's help last week plus this week I think I am gonna be ready to do them on the floor soon.

Jason, Paula, Jordana and I are prepping for Arnold's tournament next weekend, coach has helped me simplify my optional form a bit so it is not so 'heavy,' which was true.  The first section contained way too many movements.  Hopefully I can trim things down and make it flow nicely here in a couple days.  That's what I will be working on tonight.

As it stands I am just planning on doing optional Chan Quan, but I may break down and do compulsory sword ' but I think I may be putting all my efforts into polishing my optional form that I won't be ready for Jian.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I posted this on the jiayo.com forum, and wanted a copy.  Plus if anyone knows any good games lemme know.

<b>Warm-up/Conditioning Games for Wushu</b>
Actually I am interested in what conditioning and games everyone does/plays.  Mostly thinking about teaching kids, we come up with different conditioning drills disguised as games.  I was looking for ideas for my kids if anyone had anything fun to do.

When our coach went off to china and a few of us were left to run classes we made a serious effort to come up with a few new game that actually have wushu applications (strength, balance, speed, jumping, etc).  Before this we had 2 games we would play and those were circle tag and blob.  Both were played as warm-up games and their only wushu app was the speed it took to not get tagged.

For those who don't know:
Circle tag is a game where everyone stands in a circle.  One person is 'it' and is told to chase a classmate.  If the chasee stops and stands in front of a person standing in the circle they switch and the new guy must run from 'it'

Blob another tag game, but when 'it' tags someone they must then hold hands and try to catch the next person together.  Forming a blob.  Only the people on the ends can tag someone, so it is possible to escape by jumping over or going under the middle of the blob.

When I was in china I played yet another tag game, I don't have a clue what they call it, so I called it 'crossing the river' at least I called it that in my head.  Basically two people stand in the middle of a wushu carpet and the rest of the class must run to the other side with out getting tagged.  If you are tagged your out.

In china it was fun, but back home with my kids they had motivation problems, and would often just stand on their side and not run.  So I tried to make rules that everyone had to run within a certain time, but that got annoying.

The first game we made up was 'horse stance tag' which I am sure I played in grade school sometime but don't remember what we called it then.  Basically it's like freeze tag, but when you are frozen you must stand in a horse stance until someone crawls under you legs.  This game is great fun, more than I originally thought it would be -- plus you get the added benefit of horse stance training.

The most recent game that we have been playing has been dubbed 'frog battle.' This game is a lot of fun.  Basically everyone must stay in a squat, they can move around much like doing frog jumps or duck walks or turtle walks.  The rules are: only your feet can touch the ground, you can never stand up, cannot touch anything but the floor (walls, etc). The objective of the game is to knock people over.  Depending on the group we often don't allow grabbing at all.

This game is great, because you do more frog jumps and duck walks than you would ever do on your own plus you train power and balance in addition to speed.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<b>Apparently everyone that saw it thought I would be a paraplegic.</b>

I was successful in landing a back flip square on my head last night.  No, I am not getting old ' as some have suggested, but rather I was working on a fighting set.  I was supposed to kick someone and they would grab my leg and flip me.  Well, we slipped, so I only did half the flip.  I was completely surprised when my head hit the ground.  Apparently it was really scary to watch.   Everyone freaked out, and when I stood up and said I was fine no one believed me and they all made me lie down and rest.  Jason and Paula were freaking out, much more than I was.  I didn't go grab my instant icepack like I should have ' which is sort of annoying  because I have handed those out to anyone with much less sever injuries, but I was distracted and didn't think to get it.  Plus in the fall I bit my tongue and that really hurt.

At this point I think it is just muscle strains, and my neck is sore as hell.  The 3 man set is out, I am not gonna be able to do the other falls we had in there.  Plus I think the 3 of us will be too paranoid to pull it off at this point.

Thank God that we have the foam spring floor at O-Mei, if I would have done this on the original floor I think I would be in much worse shape.

Oh, it's sad now, I got voted out.  Jason called and told me I wasn't allowed to compete and if I really wanted to go they would wait and go tomorrow, but he didn't think I should.  Something about a 6 hour car ride being really unpleasant for me.  So they have opted to take the bus.  I wish I would be able to make a decision after I see Charlie, but if they are gonna catch the bus it will be when I am seeing him.  Crap.

Coach was being all sweet, she called me to check if I was OK, and to tell me to take out all the sketchy movements.  She seemed relieved when I said that I wasn't doing the group set.  Come to think of it, there is no way I could do the kip up in my Chang Quan.

Kelly is happy she gets her weekend with me back.  I feel bad for being so sad that I'm not going, when she is so happy that I am staying.  She did offer to take me in a road trip, where ever I wanted to go.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Oh, I got a new wushu game.  No, I will not take credit for it, that credit goes to one of the kids in my Chinese school class.

It's alligator tag

Say you got a river with two banks and for some reason whenever the alligator yells 'go' you just gotta cross the river. Well, that's basically how this game works.  Set up the boundaries and declare someone it.  For the rest of the players the goal is to not get tagged.  However if you get tagged you must sit down where you were tagged ' and you become an alligator and can tag people that run by, but you are not allowed to move.

Last man standing is the winner.  Well, the instructors and parents are also winners because it is cRaZy fun to watch.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Charlie Lee's was this past weekend, I had considered competing, but my neck still was bugging me at the end of the week.  So I wound up just going along to cheer, unfortunately  I had extra company, because Paula hurt herself training so she was stuck in a wheel chair.  (She got in the chair with a tornado-horse stance) The one good side of the wheeled Brazilian is her ability to get us close up at the events we were watching, however moving her around was nothing less than perilous.

One fun surprise was Qiu Dong Xing was there competing.  I hadn't heard form him in a few months and had no idea that he was headed out here for this, so it was really cool to run into him -- too bad for Jason, since he was competing in the same events.    Jason performance was actually pretty good, and I think he was scored low for his level.  He was clearly nervous during the nandao, but by the time he did nanquan he really tore up.  I even over heard some of the Chinese athletes and their fan boys talking about his level.

Oh, that was the second fun surprise, Dui Dong and Li Ying had a bunch of groupies.  Which, IMO was great.  They even printed out T-Shirts that said DX/Li Ying on the back.  And you know how NASKA works, who ever has the biggest and loudest cheering section wins ' so at this one wushu had some good representation.

Actually at dinner and then again at second late dinner I got to hang out with a few of them and they were all good home cooked wushu ren.  Mostly people from Mario's school, CMAI. I wound up skipping the night show, so I just had Qiu Dong give me a call and we (I was able to drag Glenn and Tom along) went out and met them for that second dinner at, say, midnight:30.  Meeting and hanging out with John Su and Li Ying was a double plus.

<!--This tournament was good to go to and watch, I didn't have to deal with any disappointment (competing w/ QDX and Jason), and I was able to get that proper inspirational kick in the ass that my training needed. -->

Sunday I skipped church and Chinese class because I needed A) sleep, and B) to see my wife who I neglected all day Saturday.  I did teach my kid's class, and in a strange turn of events they were <b>really</b> good.  I don't know why, but I do think the games we have been playing really help.  Mostly because I don't demand that they pay attention to wushu the entire time and to a lesser extent because I can use this as bribery: 'we won't play a game unless you do your form properly.' They are gonna make it difficult to back out of that obligation next year if they actually want to learn.  Plus I was able to talk to a couple of the parents and they seemed happy with me as an instructor.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Traditional Wushu Team Trials, they are gonna be a day before Pan Am's, or so I hear.  I need 2 traditional forms, I am thinking chain whip and drunken bare hand.  Coach suggested Drunken Straight Sword, and Ditang, but I don't think that those would be the best for me to learn in such a short amount of time.  Anyway, Stephan is doing Drunken Sword, so we will need a different weapon for the demo team, so I might as well just stick to 9 section.

I ran through some 9 section whip basics tonight, including the fun butt hopping, which I didn't mess up on once.  Now I just got to figure out a few more trick and cram them together into a form.  Drunken is not so easy]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Tuesday night was actually productive.  I started at wushu at 5, and was there till 8, the idea was that I could go give Chad a hand in teaching, but coach started teaching my drunken so he wouldn't let me teach in the hopes that I would get more traditional forms instruction.  Coach taught me some of the basics and I practiced them.  Basics for Drunken are fun.  You mostly stumble in a circle and work on over extending everything.

Today I attempted to put these basics together into a form.  I have found a couple of videos of zhi cuang and will base my form loosely on those.  However everything seems awkward and, well, silly.  But this is a silly form so I figure I otta embrace this silliness and make it my own.  At least it is fun.

I also want to try to work in a front aerial, seeing as that won't seem like such a girly trick if you are doing drunken.  Just like drunken sword is a men only event, despite the feminine weapon.

Silly, effeminate, wushu.  Where are my pink silks?

Oh, wait I am not that good yet.  One day--oh yes--one day I too will be able to don the silky pinkness, and I will wear it as a badge of honor.

Does that sound wrong to anyone else?  Sometimes I swear I picked the wrong damn sport.  Perhaps Krav is not such a bad idea.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Nikki came up and visited me, it was great seeing my lil sister.  Makes me really want to make it down and see the other sister and her family.  Of course that is a domino effect and I then want to visit the 'rents and Jason and Everett, oh yeah Paul has been sending me emails, and those keep me updated with summer -- so now I wonder about Katy Jo and Sara.  .  I also am itching to get down there and train with the VCU wushu club -- it was before team trails that I got invited to go visit and haven't made it down there.

I miss Richmond; it is such a medium happy for me.  Plus Joshua and Jacob make it double fun.

We had a fun weekend, I was a little weirded out by the fact that my lil sister actually drank, of course it's not like she was going nuts -- I guess a year or two of taking care of drunk Radfordites will instill moderate habits.  Nice lazy Saturday after a super late Friday night was refreshing, even though we stayed up till 2 that night.

The most surprising event of the weekend was when I went by wushu early to train.  When I got there I called coach to tell her that I was gonna miss the night classes because my sister was in town.  I happened to mention that I was training early.  She said something about being a little late.  I assumed that was late for the 5 o'clock class, well about 15 minutes later she showed up.  Apparently I asked her to come early.  I felt bad about that, however I am not one to refuse the help, so we were able to finish the first section of my drunken.  And by finish I mean completely scrap the old one and make a new section one.  It is much cooler than before, imho.  Now as far as the form goes I need to practice breathing, because when I stumble around flailing (as is customary in a drunken form) I find I am holding my breath.  And here I was thinking this was going to be less tiring than CQ.

A bit of advice: don't fall on your head before learning drunken, you use you neck a lot.  Kip-ups, back falls, suicides, black dragon kip ups -- they are all big neck moves.  However I cannot complain too much because I still have my MCL and ACL in tact, unlike certain Brazilians I know.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Ok, so my wife thinks I should of written something about the closing on my house already, but honestly it was such an easy painless experience that I didn't have much to say.  At least not much that is actually interesting.  However, I am a little weary -- because what if it was too easy.  I mean, they'd slap down a paper and we'd sign it.  Sure, the promised they were all standard government drafted loan documents, but by the time I left I'd sign just about anything.  "Sign in blood, eh?  No problem"

But we closed, we are all done, and we now own a house.  Alas, we have tenets until next month -- so not only are we land owners, but slum lords as well.  Oh, one interesting thing was they were not going to give us a key.  Citing something about the sellers not moving out until next month.  Luckily our argument of we own the place and we get a key worked like a charm.

Yesterday was Tom's last day here, he is moving out to the client full time now.  We are getting a new programmer, but I fear this may lead to boringer days in the office.  In order to give him a proper send off we ordered a party platter of chicken nuggets form Chick-fil-A.  It was a hundred nuggets and a bowl of honey mustard.  We ate all but 7.  We did not eat the bone we found, or that little black string.  We did eat from 11am to about 2:30pm.  Near the end there the grease started to congeal and we started to feel a little ill.  At happy hour after work I know I got queasy at the idea of anything fried.  Oh, I never, ever want chicken nuggets again.  Ever.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Fun at the outer banks, it was great seeing Brandon and Alan again, even Gerald stopped in on Sunday on his way back to Raleigh.  Brandon's beach house is amazing; Danny and I could not decide it was Awesome or Super-Great.  Plenty of beds, lots of common room, the coolest wrap around deck ever.  Let's not overlook the hot tub.

Needless to say we had a great time; the weather was warm enough that we were able to get a little pink on our shoulders when we were playing out on the sand.  There was plenty of cartwheels and handstands, sparring and pushing people over people who were kneeling behind them, splashing in the freezing water (it was so could my foot would cramp up and burn).  Plus an elaborate sand structure with a tower, dais, archer wall, and an elaborate system of motes, walls, channels and aqueducts.  And we cannot forget the white water rafting sea shells.

We chased that with a nap, a hot tubing and wallyball.  However I have no idea what order all this occurred in.  Wallyball was insanely fun, however the room lacked ventilation and as we sweated so did the floor.  A floor that sweats is a floor the slips, so it got a little dangerous there at the end.  Dangerous, but still fun.

The drive there and back were not as bad as I thought they were gonna be, and I feel that I have the right to say that since I was the only one to drive the entire time there and back.  However, the little highways in NC were more than a little annoying with the 45-55-45-55-35-50-45-50-45-55 speed changes every 3 miles.  Big wide road, plenty of visibility, no traffic, s-l-o-w driving.  Brandon warned us of tickets, and when he warns of that we listen.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I went and visited Paula in the hospital yesterday.  She was being monitored because they found blood clots in her lungs.  Apparently the clots formed in her leg when she ripped the hell out of her MCL/ACL, then the doctor told her not to move at all if she wants her MCL to heal, so she kept it a minimum of movement (bathroom trips, twice a day).  Now she has sharp chest pains.  Luckily she should be fine and out of the hospital in a couple of days.  I'll be praying that her knee gets all better soon.  Poor girl.  Stupid tornado-horsestance on puzzle mats.

It has been a pretty hectic day actually.  As soon as I got in B mentioned that I must not check my voicemail, and guess what, I don't, so I had a message form him saying don't' come up--lets just go to the mechanic.  So instead I just headed right back down and then we want off to the car connection.  We picked up one the car from one shop and drove across town to drop it off.  I was starving.  We didn't eat.  I called Kelly and her mom was coming into town so they could go measure and look at paint samples in the new house.  Well, not wanting to be left out I insisted on joining them, unfortunately  the only restaurant we know of in Burke is McDonalds, so we met there (we were supposed to meet at the house, but I was late).  I ate a 10 piece McNuggets.  They had salad.  I regret it now.  We went and played at the house, and that was fun.  I like Bandit, the grey and white cat that can go outside, who was all affectionate and purr-in'.  Now I feel really tired and it is lonely in my office as all the people I know are gone.  I think I will go home and take a nap.  ...zzzZZZZzzzZZZzzz...zzz......]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Car related dreams.  I had two dreams that stuck with me very vividly last night.

I can't remember which one cam first, but I think it was the jeep one.  Basically I was in my jeep in a parking lot and a mini-van pulled up beside me.  Before the van could pull all the way into the spot the little girl in the back kicked the door open crazy hard and it swung in the side of the jeep.  I just sat there stunned thinking "crap, she just dented the hell out of my jeep."  Her parents yelled at her to shut the door so they could pull further forward, and along the way she did it again.  And again once they had reached their final stopping point.  By then she was directly beside me with her door resting agenst my front fender.  I looked at the little girl--who was probably around 7 or 8--and say "DAMMIT!!!",  which seemed like a reasonable thing for me to say after the 3rd instance of body damage she inflicted on my vehicle.  I was expecting her parents to back me up and tell their little girl to not hurt other peoples cars, but instead they yelled at me for using bad language around their daughter. I think it was at this point that my subconscious decided that I could not just dismiss this attack on my jeep and go on with the dream (which I am sure would have involved bouncy shoes).  I finally got out to inspect the damage which turned out to be much more extensive than you would think I little girl armed with a mini-van door could have done, but it was.  Big nasty softball size dents, the paint completely missing--in three places.  I tracked down the parents to get insurance information or some place to send the bill, they came over and examined the damage.  Continually grumbling about my bad language.  About then I woke up.  I am sure if I woulda kept sleeping, the parents would have turned out to be evil ninja pirates and I woulda wushu'd them proper, but I woke up by then.

So I got up, went to tinkle, and came back to bed for my second car related dream.  This one involved me parking Kelly's car in the Ballston mall (however in the dream I often referred to it as Tyson's).  Don't remember why we were there, or what we did, but when we were walking out to leave we found out someone stole the engine, transmission and other important mechanical parts.  This time they even stole the radio (it's a recurring dream, last time they left the radio--which was nice so we had something to listen to).  The rest of the dream consisted of me tracking down the wife and informing her that our engine was stolen AGAIN.  Something she wasn't so happy about, but surprisingly supportive and polite.  I'll let you know what happens next time.

It was a pretty fun weekend: I got new Tevas, a Lacrosse Stick, and a Puerto Rican.  And especially flippy, wushu-nastic one.  Actually Coach asked me Saturday during class if I could put up one of the Puerto Rican team members while they cam to train.  I hesitantly asked when he was coming.  She said at 9.  How long? A week.   I agreed after calling and clearing it with a bewildered wife.  Winds up not being much of an issue as Jonathan is a really cool guy, and he sleeps in the office on the foof.  (If he woulda come in a few more weeks we woulda had an entire guest room.) He will be hanging out at O-Mei for the week, and is all excited bout going to capital for tumbling.  I am also excited about this, as he has not failed to impress me and my friends with his cRaZy cool tricks.  I am jealous of his press-ups and windmills.  Now, I just needa figure out how to use that damn lacrosse stick, I am sure Danny and I looked like mentally handicapped first graders trying to figure out how they worked in the parking lot at Galyan's (after buying them on an impulse, but how can you resist the LAX balls are orange!).]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I am sore (specifically my left calf and left butt cheek).  I have been training a lot recently, and while I am supposed to compete this weekend I haven't been working on anything that I will actually do at the competition.  Last night I actually trained compulsory, and in the morning it was drunken.

I went with Jonathan to the morning training along with Chad and Stephan.  It was good hard training -- plus with the night before consisting of sword class chased by gymnastics I had not fully recovered before I showed up.  Strange thing, I totally crashed a butterfly.  Well, I was doing the second of two and I somehow did a twist.  I didn't want to twist, but I did.  I crashed it politely (I do remember seeing the ceiling in the middle, and thinking 'Oh crap, the ceiling').  After that I was having a serious complex and couldn't do a butterfly with out the crazy feeling that I was rotating.  It freaked me out.  It still freaks me out.  I don't know what made me do that, and it has happened before when I train a lot of twists and try to go back to regular butterflies. I own butterflies.  That is my trick.  Dammit!

I think part of the problem was the fact that I had another freak 'loss of skill that I normally own,' in class earlier this week (Monday I think) we were just jumping up and doing a 'standing jump outside jump' a.k.a. jump and spin.  Normally I have no problem with a 720.  I couldn't do a 360 with out leaning.  It was freakish.  It was disturbing.  I didn't like it.  I tried again yesterday it my jump-n-spin seemed to be back to normal.   However I seem to have this sinking feeling like that skill is gone.  It's scary.

Now I have to try to concentrate on this tournament AND deal with freaky skill loss.  Zao gao le!]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Easter Weekend.

Friday I watched Jason clean up the short weapon event at CMAI's tournament.  His nandao was able to keep Nick and the crazy 12 year old from NY from taking home the tallest trophy.  After the competition we went back to the school where I was able to run through my form (and drill that butterfly - butterfly twist), and we talked with coach for quite some time.  We were even able to convince her that going to the tournament was a good idea, even though she didn't want anyone else to go.

The next day I got up and out there before 8.  Registered for my event (a mere $70 to do my form once) and waited.  I got lucky that I went second as it was first to register last to compete.  I don't remember actually doing my form, except for the part that I forgot and just made stuff up.  I even asked Paula if she could tell what part I just made up--but my adlib skills paid off and I was hid my stupidity pretty well.

I wound up in second.  I was happy that I beat the people that I was worried about, but I was taken by this (wushu autistic) 12 year old.  He *was* competing out of his division, and as Kelly pointed out that in the sport he does have certain advantages that the adult group lacks.  Like, say, his 80 lbs is not so hard to spin around.  This kid will be unstoppable if he survives puberty.  Wushu has lost a lot of good competitors to puberty. I was happy with my 9.29 from the judges (which wound up a higher score than Jason's empty hand--so I beat the #1 US team member &#91;to his credit he did fall, most likely because the floor so slippery&#93;).

We hung around for a little while after my event; we back to the school and took Jonathan to lunch.  Well, actually coach treated us--but we picked the place.  Apparently I have introduced her to all the American restaurants in the area that she has visited.  I did try to explain that Chevy's was Mexican, but I don't think that took.

Then we were on the road to Richmond.

My parents have been smoking something, because that were ridiculously laid back happy go lucky and otherwise crazy.  Not bad, but weird as hell.  But the evening consisted of getting a free bed from Kelly's boss, and hanging out with Jason.  Jason and I stayed up till the wee hours of the night talking, which was good.  I was really glad to see him and hang out some. Too bad the talking centered on girl troubles.

Sunday I slept in late as a result of the wee-talking.  But I was up before Jacob, Joshua, Matt and Laura got there.  Jacob was crazy (especially once he got hopped up on Jelly beans). Joshua was drooly and otherwise very cute. We had brunch.  We had and Easter egg hunt.  We ate candy.  It was fun.

Wednesday we move get possession of our new house.

I can't wait for my house.  I want to go today.  It's driving me nuts. I want to be already moved-ed.  Agghh.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Paint paint paint.  If I ever seen another roll of that blue tape again it will be too soon.

Actually I am really happy with how everything has turned out; it's too bad that the living/dining room is the only completely finished room in the house.  The bedroom, kitchen and office need trim painted.  The office could probably use another coat of that bothersome maroon.  I don't recommend painting anything maroon.  It will take a lot of coats.  I am up to 3 now, and it needs more.

Ok, the quick rundown of the colors:
Kitchen:  Pink baby!
Living/dining Room:  Light blue and lighter blue on different walls, except the striped wall.  That wall rocks.
Bedroom:  A soothing green, with grayish tendencies.
Office:  Pure Hokie, Orange and maroon.  Orange is easy to paint.

We have hauled most of our stuff over already, I went ahead and canceled our truck for the first, mostly because we have 3 big things left to haul (couple of dressers and a bed, easy) and then we are stuck with little crap.

Moving sucks, but owning a house is awesome.  I like being in the house and thinking, I own you. OWN YOU, BIATCH! Succeeding in obtaining a living space that is not the routine, colorless, vapid builders white that we have lived in for 8+ years is a very good thing.  Even the furniture looks better.

I was completely exhausted this past weekend, it is nice to be back at work where I am not consistently lifting things that are heaver than, say, me.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[So  I grab my laptop and drag it over to the new house.  Guess what happens when I turn it on, yep, I got a wireless connection.  Good ole linksys, jsut leaving it's ass hanging out in the open like that.

Hmm, maybe I should cancel that DSL order that I have been waiting on.  Verizon has given me the run around a couple of times on the phone when I call up and ask technical Questions.

Mooching off of the neibours before I even meet them is fun.

It's late.  It's the first night in my house.  My wife is in richmond.

D, D, J and S:  Thanks for all the help.

 I havn't trained in a week - I don't miss it (least not yet).  I miss sleeping however.  G'Night.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[The blast from the past

So Kelly and I woke up to a call from my parents saying they had given my phone number to an old friend of mine from when I lived in cali.  I hadn't seen Brian since I was a freshman in high school, so it had been a while.  Turns out he is pretty much the same old Brian I knew, but now he is in the Army, has been to war, gotten shot, and is attempting to enter the Special Forces.  Crazy.  We has a beer, ate some wings and he kicked my ass in pool.

I am glad last week is now last week.  I need to be back at work so I can rest. But the good news it we are all moved.  We are all moved before we were even gonna start moving. Being done early is nice.  I am to the point that all I need is to wire the office for the DSL and everything will be turned in and working.

Friday I trained at the afternoon class, which wound up being a private lesson.  Coach stayed around and helped me work out the third section of my Zui Quan. I basically modified a section that I found in one of the videos I downloaded -- I swear coach picked it up in 5 seconds, and then had to spend 15 minutes teaching it to me. Plus, another 30 correcting it.

My parents wound up coming up to A) check out the new house and B) get the truck back in order to haul a new (non-leaking) hot water heater to their house.  I felt bad for using their truck and not even having the decency to take it back to them when I was done.  But I was really happy they could see the new place.

Work now -- I got a lot to make up after a week of really short days last week.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<b>How to wire your house for DSL in 17 easy steps.</b>

<b>Step 1:</b> Determine that the existing wiring is insufficient for carrying your precious DSL signal.
<b>Step 2:</b> Determine that the easiest way to run wire will be up the side of the house behind the gutter beside the coax that is already installed.
<b>Step 3:</b> Go to Radio Shack during your lunch break and buy all the stuff you need.
<b>Step 4:</b> Go to Home Depot after work and buy all the stuff you need again, but higher quality stuff at a cheaper price.
<b>Step 5:</b> Run the CAT3 out the guest room wall through using a wire coat hanger, packing tape, Lacrosse stick, and metal tie rack/hanger thingy.  This will require you to tape the cable to the coat hanger.  This will also require you to tape the tie rack thing to the lacrosse stick. You may or may not be required to dangle out the 3rd story window, cursing, while swing a tie rack (which has been fastened to a lacrosse stick for reach) at a coat hanger taped to a phone cable that is hung up on some piece of plastic that is wrapped around the coax on the side of the house.
<b>Step 6:</b> Hold the CAT3 though the window and yank the coat hanger free from the tape.
<b>Step 7:</b> Use the coat hanger to run the phone cord through the hole in the basement, preferable while standing in the rain.
<b>Step 8:</b> Become very confused as to why there are 2 lines running into the house form the phone box.  Determine that one was patched in for the basement phone jack alone.  Unplug the other one and try the upstairs phone, which will magically still work.  Get confused.
<b>Step 9:</b> Pull the wire back out of the basement wall and attach it to the phone box directly, in the rain.  It is recommended that ones wife hold the umbrella over the phone box.
<b>Step 10:</b> Return unneeded parts to radio shack and get hotdog at Costco.
<b>Step 11:</b> Arrive home around 10 pm and begin drilling though the ceiling.  This is a convenient way of telling your neighbor <i>"good night"</i>.
<b>Step 12:</b> climb into the attic to try to find the cable you fed up though the hole. This is a convenient time to notice that the insulation is very thick and makes it difficult to find the cable.  Also notice the huge TV antenna that apparently came with the house.
<b>Step 13:</b> Get Wife to bang on the ceiling so you can use echolocation to find the hole with a wire.  This is also a way of telling the neighbor <i>"sweet dreams"</i>.
<b>Step 14:</b> Determine the knocking is insufficient so ask for "digging tools" from the wife.  She should arrive with a screwdriver (medium flathead), a hammer and a multipurpose paint tool. Take the hammer.
<b>Step 15:</b> Find the hole under a HVAC duct, be happy you didn't drill though that. Begin pulling the cable though.  When it gets tangled yell for the wife to come help.  Every few feet the cable will get tangled, so the wife will yell something unintelligible, wait and she will dutifully untangle it.
<b>Step 16:</b> After dropping the cable back thought the attic opening into the office inspect the VT antenna and its wiring. Trace the coax back to the far wall and notice there is a big gap in that wall that the wire runs down, noting that this would be a perfect place to run a CAT3 UTP phone cable.
<b>Step 17:</b> Wash the very itchy insulation off, crimp on a new RJ11 (really RJ14, but everyone calls them 11's) and test it out.  If fatigue is becoming a problem at this point, strip the live twisted pair with your teeth for a lively jolt of energy.  And a numb lip.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Don't do wheelies...or plumbing.  They are bad for you.

First off, the wheelies.  It was a gorgeous day and thusly Danny and I decided to go the skate park so we hopped into the jeep (which was in its full top down door-less glory) head out.  But first we had to stop at Sean's parent's house for updating his flash plugin so that he could watch the new [homestarrunner cartoons](http://www.homestarrunner.com).  It was on route 50, on the way to Van Dyke park.  We were getting annoyed because the traffic was so heavy on a Saturday afternoon, so when we were sitting at the light and a couple of BiKeRboyZ decided to skip the line and zip between cars to sit out at the front we were bitching about them little punks.  Light turned green.  The both punched it and popped their front wheels off the ground and sped off in wheelies.  I couldn't quite see both guys,  the one in my line was obscured by the car in front of me, but I do remember thinking that I had a good enough view when I saw that motorcycle flipping end over end in the air.  Danny even saw him sliding down the road.  We thought this was gonna end in complete badness.  But the boy jumped right up to his feet and walked off the road.  I pulled over and made sure he was OK.  He seemed to be much more embarrassed than hurt -- the only visible injury was a skinned knee through his jeans.

For the rest of that day every time I saw someone on a motorcycle I would b e a nervous feeling.  And as a public service we would yell at them when they went by to encourage them to abstain from the wheelie.

I hate plumbing. Indoor running water is for losers. While Kelly was sleeping on the couch Sunday afternoon, recovering from being up most of the before, I discovered that the kitchen sink was leaking.  I investigated thoroughly and determined that the leak was coming form up inside the sink.  So I quizzed Kelly over how much she liked that faucet, and we determined that we didn't care for it so much and headed off to home depot to get the replacement.  There was a short interruption in the middle for going to Chinese school, finding out that the school had a play that weekend, canceling class, and heading home. Oh, and I decided that I wanted to take out the old faucet so that I could take it with me to Home Depot - so I embarked on an adventure in removing plumbing.  Nothing was easy to remove, even the shutoff valves were so stiff that I needed a wrench to turn the handles (and eventually strip them completely).  I even had visions of inadvertent removal of the entire valve and the ensuing hilarity and mass amounts of water.  But I eventually got it off, but not until after plenty of swearing.  Fun fact about my house:  the floor under the sink is actually a few inches lower than the floor in the kitchen -- much lower than a normal cabinet should be. Something about working under a sink, leaning on a 2" wide piece of wood, holding you upper body up so you can use both hands to strip a bolt (that you would much rather just loosen), behind a disposal tangled up in the lines that run to and from the dish washer, while trying to blink at <i>just</i> the right time to prevent the little flakes of fiberglass that are being scraped off the bottom of the sink from falling in your eyes; just makes me want to swear a lot. Eventually we talked to the guy at the depot, debated over faucets and cam back home. Installing the new faucet was much easier because 1) I could look at it first and figure out how it is supposed to work and 2) it came with the a special tool to remove the impossi-nut that was impossible to remove from the old one.

We bolted everything on tight, sent Kelly to turn on the main water and proceeded to finish stripping the hot water cutoff valve handle, then proceeding to unscrew it and using a pair of pliers to ever-so-slowly turn it back on. Repeated with the cold water valve and tested everything.  It all appeared to be working; we even had the hot and cold water hooked up to the proper sides.

Then it was off to Friendly's for some mediocre food and poor service to celebrate!]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<b>Dumb bugs</b>

Cicadas are dumb bugs.  Really really dumb.  You can kick them and they just sit there.  You can mow the lawn and they will lookup and wonder what the loud machine is and why it is chopping up all their friends.  I had one on the hood of my jeep this morning, it was alive, I saw it move.  But when I started up the jeep it just sat there.  When I accelerated down the street it slid across the hood.  No reaction. None.  He slid back and forth as I made the turns though my neighborhood. Didn't flinch.  Eventually he fell off the side of the jeep, I never saw him try to fly.  I can only assume he hit the ground in total shock, surprised that his perch somehow disappeared.

<b>Training</b>

Training last night was, well, uninspired.  Chad, being the good man he is, brought his camera so that we could film ourselves review why we suck.  This is actually a really good training tool unless you watch your routine and determine that you suck so much that you should just retire from that damn sport.  Plus add in the fact that my breasts are sore from lifting and I felt like I looked awkward and disproportional and pudgy doing my form only added to the disillusionment. Bah.

I told Kelly that I wanna train at [Krav](http://www.fightersgarage.com/home/index.html) with Sean and she said that was fine (in fact she encouraged me to do it sooner than later).  If I am going to be able to stick with wushu I need to ease back from the all wushu all the time mentality.  Of course when I start thinking like this I also get this streak of obnoxious determination to push like hell and work though my wu-funk.  I think it when it really comes down to it I need to go to Krav and kick stuff so that I feel better about how much I suck at prancing around in silks with little floppy swords.

<b>Blacksburg</b>

We went down tot Tech at the end of last week (drove down Thursday night, and back on Friday night).  I miss Blacksburg.  Our time was very limited so we tried to fit as much in as possible.  We hit up Hokie House, which was insanely packed with drunken grads and no music, met up with Cheryl, tried get a turn at the table to play shuffle board, and played some pool.  Eh, I didn't go out much in school.  But on the way back to the four points we walked the long way though campus.  I really miss it there, it feels right, it feels like home.  I guess part of it is the fact that I almost never lived anywhere for 4 years solid, much less never went to the same school for that long that the 4 years at VT seem like half my life.  Even after I graduated, 5 companies, two layoffs and 3 apartments (including my house &#91;yay house!&#93;) later I don't feel so settled up here.   So it comes down to the fact that I really need to find a job at the CRC and move back to the burg.

<b>Family</b>

My Nana was out this way visiting Joshua and Jacob--she did bring Grandpa Jim and did visit the rest of the family too.  But my parents came up, with Nana, Jim, and the my sisters family in tow.  Kelly arranged for her parents to come out and meet everyone, so we had a big happy family gathering on Saturday.  Fun activities like the playground down by the lake, the new air and space museum, and a BBQ.  It was great to have everyone together and visit with the Grandparents.  They are doing well, better than the last time I saw them. I must get to Texas and visit.]]></content:encoded>

And by saying so it makes me so damn cool it hurts.  The Science Channel did a retro weekend and played all these great old school PBS and (even better) BBC educational series.     Gerald and I sat watching for, ionno hours.  Then he left--when I had to go teach my last Chinese school class ever (only two kids cried)--and I cam home and watched more.

This weekend was a success.  We had a good house warming party--a crazy expensive party--but a successful one.  We had somewhere near 40 people show up, and I didn't even invite everyone I wanted to, I wound up missing a number of people I know from wushu and past jobs.  Everyone said we had a nice house, and no one did anything destructive to make it un-nice.

The cicadas are in full force.  Infact if you drive down Braddock road with the windows down you cannot hear anyone talking in the car they are so loud.  Also, as D and I discovered they like street lights.  The ground under the street light on Cotherstone was crawling with them.  You could not walk with out stepping on them--and we didn't go anywhere near the densest part of the cicada blanket.  The sound was overwhelmingly eerie.

Also if you try to flick them up in the air with your car keys they won't fly, they just sorta fall over.  So if you want to hit them with a softball bat you are going to have find one that is already airborne.]]></content:encoded>

This was the first time we lifted together, but I hope we can continue with it.  I think I may invest in more equipment,   or what ever else I can do to bribe the fellas.  Stuff like this is much more fun if you have someone else there.  Plus I could do bench press because I had someone to lift the bar up and spot me, normally I am haunted by the fact that I have no barbell  rack.  I will prolly stop and get a couple of big plates on the way home, maybe one of those heavy duty mats to protect the carpet.  Now if I could only figure out where to hang the pull up bar  (I got a 6' piece of aircraft grade aluminum piping, just need to figure where I can mount it).

Best part is I don't feel silly doing things like handstand pushups and dead lifts (I have never seen anyone do proper dead lifts in the gym.  Ever.  Squats sure, maybe a stiff-legged dead lift, but never a normal one--everyone always stares at me when I do them.  Of course that could be because of the loud clanging sounds I make when I drop the bar.

Traditional forms are coming along s-l-o-w-l-y,  very slowly.  I need to finish my drunken, tonight.  I swear if I don't have coach help me with the form I just flounder around and nothing gets done.  But she can throw it together and everything looks great and has a terrific flow.  Don't get me started in chain whip.  No, really, I haven't started.

Gymnastics tonight should be drilling butterfly-butterfly twist and aerial twist.  Ever since I crashed the b-bt (back before cmai's tourney) I have been spooked by that combo.  So I need to drill it back to normalcy.  My aerial twists are getting very consistent, and I am able to keep them nice and high, but I still haven't bothered to do them on the hard floor.  I am getting to the point where I am gonna pay Stephan to come along to capital in order to give me a challenge.  I am asking for a challenge!

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Chica-flop.  Well, the great road trip to Chicago never happened.  Mostly 'cause we suck.

But the memorial weekend wasn't completely a loss.  Except that I did hurt my shoulder in class on Friday, and it still hurts on Tuesday (one thing that would of been a serious pain in the car for 13 hours).  But we did make it downtown to a few memorials, go to a movie or two, hang out with fun people, throw a few caps, and BBQ (as is required by law on Memorial Day).

Stupid drunken form.  Coach asked me if I could do this new movement, and well, yeah I could, but I think the real question was should I.  This movement is sort of a kipup were you arch and roll onto your knees, up your belly and over your should to another kipup.  Repeat 3X.  The biggest problem is I am actually good at it, and (at least in my head) it looks super-cool. But after the first pass my shoulder hurt.  I blamed it on lifting soreness.  So I did it again, and at least once more after that.  Now that I have had all weekend to think about this, I remember that this is one of reasons I went to visit Charlie.  Damn, I may be going back again.  Needless to say I think that skill is gonna be dropped.  It was such a kickass section three.

After that I just wanted to sit around and no be active.  So we went to the movies, played  video games, etc.  Came close to totally wasting the best day -- at least in terms of weather -- of the entire weekend, it wasn't a total waste mostly due to the topless jeep.   We even wound up meeting up with Tom and Mer for some post dinner chillin', which was a fun time.  I wanted to call them back later that weekend and hang out some more, but decided that would make me appear all needy.  So I called some wushu friends.  They dissed me.

<img src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/blog/image/595/ww2.jpg" align="left">Following the hint form Tom and Meredith, we went downtown Sunday night to check out the WWII and FDR memorials.  Both were really touching, I think the FDR is one of the best in DC.  Sure, the WWII one is much more impressive, FDR just seemed so real with the life-sized bronze statues and the quotes engraved in the walls.

Monday consisted of pouting about the bad weather, playing video games, noticing the weather was better and going to play tennis, deciding that it was a bad idea to play tennis and going home to make burgers and brats.  Least you thought they were brats while you dumped mustard on them, but once you bite into it you notice that Italian sausage is a little strange with mustard.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I had never been to a major league baseball game before this weekend.  I had attempted to watch a few games in the past, I mean the long ago past, when I lived in Alaska.  We figured out a back way into the field (we would go though the woods in the four wheelers) so we didn't have to pay the $5 to get in, but they were overwhelmingly boring.  We would play catch on the side of the field, get bored and leave.

Going to Camden Yards was much better, if you get bored you go buy peanuts and chomp on them for a while.  Then a hot dog, then some cotton candy, etc.  I was able to build up enough faux interest in the O's that it was a fun game to watch.    Not as much fun as playing catch for the first time in, ionno, 10 years.  My mitt has 3 different colors of mold on it.  But it still catches a ball.

Training this week picked up nicely.  After I got the acupuncture on my shoulder I sat out a few classes, but came back no problem, no pain.  Even the cyst on back of my hand is doing better.  It had been really tender after Charlie worked on it but now it seems to be getting better, much faster than it was on its own.  Training has consisted of drunken and jiu jie bian (9 section whip)  as of late.  I am still at 3 section of drunken and only 1 official section of jjb.  However jjb is crazy fun, and not demanding physically, it feels more like playing with a dibolo than training wushu.   I got less than a month to get these things finished and polished.  I also got rug burn in 3 places.  Stupid drunken.

Oh, why dose everyone think <i>Antigone</i> is such a crappy name for a girl?  I think it is pretty damn cool.  It's up there with <i>Rizqi</i>.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I have been swamped as of late.  Work has consisted of a constant push to get our damn Solaris machine up and running.  I am caught up in a hell of failed builds and unreasonable dependencies.   I'll get you ClearSilver, you better watch your back.  UPDATE:  I smacked that Sun around, now I oWnZ it.

Wushu has been interesting lately, it's all traditional all the time.  Aside from the fact that it has been obscenely hot and humid, in an industrial park warehouse like building with cinder block walls and a metal roof, training has been going well.  I have cranked out more of my 9 section whip form -- which, IMO, is the easiest form I know (so far).  I just need to slow down and figure out how do the sections and take my time to build up to speed.  Once I know it, and know it well enough to be consistent I can force some speed out of it.  Nice thing about whip is that you don't need much flavor, the weapon brings all the spice itself.  I just gotta keep it moving quick.

Drunken is progressing, slower than 9 section, but progressing.  Marty even complemented me on it, which was unexpected, but coming from him I take that as a very good complement.  He don't say much unless he has a reason.

Lets, see, last weekend we went down to Richmond -- Mom's birthday and all.  We did the cake thing, played with the nephews.  Jumped on the trampoline with Jacob.  Played army on the trampoline with Jacob, and the like.  It was nice to see them.  It was also nice to see that Joshua hasn't grown up too much since I saw him last.  With Jacob it seemed like every time I saw him he had passed 2 or 3 major milestones in life.  One day I'd see him working on crawling, then the next time he'd be walking and talking.  I felt left out.  So far I am doing a *little* better with Joshua.

I also saw Jason.  He came over and hung at my 'rents house for a while.  He is going pretty well now, dealing with his woman situation (still hangs out with her, aiya).  He is supposed to graduate this summer, so is considering driving across America.  Sorta a coming of age, need to see the country, get away from home type thing.  He needs it, and I thought it'd be fun so I asked him if he wanted a buddy for the drive.  I got a hearty 'come along' answer.  So I may be going along with him.  I wouldn't be able to do the entire thing, as that may take up to 3 weeks, but I might go for one leg of the journey and just fly back home.  Now we needa decide which route (northern or southern), and a list of things to do along the way.  Right now I am leaning towards the northern route.  The list of things to do is gonna be trickier, but we have a few ideas:  Attempt to drive Red Evil up Pikes Peak, Eat a hotdog on the El, ride horses in Wyoming, etc.

Of course if I go with Jason the trip to the cabin with Danny would have be nix'd.   Honestly, I don't really care about the trips them selves, I just want to hang out with the guys involved.   Sitting in a cabin, or driving across country neither one sound like much fun.

Lesson for the day:  Make sure you are you sing the correct linker.  /opt/sfw/bin/ld is not your friend.  That punk.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I finally saw last action star last night.  No wushu in it this time, it was all drama acting and a make-over.  Last week when people were telling me how they were training with Eric Chen and all the wushu fun I was really regretting not sending in my demo video.  After watching the show last night I am <b>really</b> glad I didn't.  It was a bunch of uber-vain super-cool pretty people.  While I may be vain, and even have veins, I am not nearly cool or pretty enough for all that.  I would have loved that stunt work, and even the acting drills but this other stuff, all the <i>MTV Real World</i> schisms and bickering really doesn't seem like anything worth while.  Not that I could have gotten that far, due to my personal levels of coolness and prettiness.

Yesterday we did good.  At least Chad and I (Stephan== slacker), we hit up lifting in the morning, wushu and gymnastics that night.  I admit it was pretty slack, I didn't do dead lifts in the morning and I trained jiu jie bian at wushu.  Even gymnastics should have been harder, but I was pretty happy.  The only thing I left out was more tumbling.  I <b>need</b> to be drilling the stuff I already know, especially the things like tumbling that I won't practice anywhere else.

Scariest dream ever:  running from a evil version of yourself.   Only I could climb walls, and had some sorta double jointed jaw with extra longer, sharper, insect like teeth.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[We were actually there when Beej and Katie got the call that they got their house.  The womens even did shots of tequila to celebrate.   They had to run off and deal with some paper work but Kelly took Laura, Sean and I back home and we got to play.  We all got yelled at to not mark the walls.  Mostly we ignored it.

This weekend was a glorious sun worshiping excursion.  Lots of time at the pool, sometimes I would be at one pool, grab my stuff and head over to a different pool.  Best part of it all is no sunburn.

Wushu is going so far.  We have two weeks till traditional team trials.  While this is not the actual US Team, it is still important for me.  Entirely superficial reasons, but they are still there.  I know I have the real team trials next year, but I feel the need to push for this one, with all it's fakeness.

With that I saw Zach's traditional forms, ditang and double broadsword, which inspired me.  He has some crazy tricks in his forms--including hyper twists, aerial twists and aerial falls. His tricks and speed are ridiculous, I cannot believe how good he gets training on his own like he does.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/blog/image/595/kittens.jpg" align="left"/><b>Kittens!</b>

After years of talking about it Kelly and I finally broke down and adopted kittens. They are two nearly identical black kittens, brothers, that we got from the Fairfax animal shelter.  Their names are Ampere and Henry.  The more active, bolder and slightly bigger one is Amp, and the smaller one is Henry.  Of course being the smaller one Henry has a crazy psycho furious side that only seems to come out when they are wrestling.

Kelly has never had cats before, and you can tell that we really likes them -- I knew for sure when she was upset that she couldn't take care of them when she traveled to Richmond.  Not that she doesn't trust me, I think it is a quality of care issue.  Anyway, who wants to be stuck in my care.  Ok, who wants to be stuck in my care that is nto obsessed with <i>Chris moves</i>.

Oh, in addition to kittens we also had had a BBQ and went down to the mall for the fireworks.  I tricked a few coworkers into coming over and of course there was the wushu click.  Basically I just plopped the wushu guys down in front of China national qualifiers and paid attention to other people.  Fireworks were crazy, so many people, much like the other times we have gone down town.  Didn't get rained on and nobody got lost.  It was a success.

I think I am ready for Traditionals.  I have both my jiu jie bian and zuiquan down, both of them could really use another month of practice, but I will be able to get thought them with the bare minimum of flavor and speed.  Drunken is still crazy long--a whopping 1:49 at it's longest--but I have been taking stuff out as best I can.  Pretty much anything that isn't required for the main structure of the form is gone.  I still float around 1:20.  jiu jie bian has stuck around 1:20, but I am happy with that because I know I won't go under time and can try to make everything quick.  Plus that is such an easy (as in easy-on-your-body) form.  It's gonna be rough when I go back to training spear.

Right now training is so good. But I know once Panams are over that it will fizzle out.  Damn, just when I talked my self out of Krav I may be inspired to try and go again.  I shouldn't.  <i>Team trials next year</i>.  Damn you the wushu!]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I have been copying the 2004 China National Qualifier Tapes all day.  I am not sure what I think about all the changes.  They all do the same difficulty movements, the easiest ones for the most points.  The new rules have allowed a few liberties in the costumes they are wearing.  First off, I don't feel like I can refer to them as uniforms anymore, they are clearly costumes.  The worst of all is on one of my favorite competitors, Cai yang.  That little kid, that poor kid.  I swear he is wearing a girl's clubbing shirt and silk Capri pants.  It is one of those backless shirts that is simply a square turn on its corner, with a string holding the top around you neck and another tied from the two side coroners around his back.  The silk Capri pants need no explanation.  I expect the German team to wear lederhosen and perform to polka music now.   I call dibbs on the stars and stripes karate gi, oh--with the mortal kombat music.

It is also popular to throw your broadsword.  Throwing swords doesn't make since to me.  The spear and staff don't seem so bad.  But why the swords?  Isn't that the stupidest thing you could do if you were in a fight and you had a sword.  It's almost as stupid as jumping and spinning while twirling your weapon.  Wait.  N'mind.

This all makes me very sad for the wushu.

I am not one of those people that bitch and moan about how wushu is turning into gymnastics, I think most of the difficulty movements are just the natural progression of the sport.   I understand some of these new changes are the wushu-powers-that-be's attempt to make this more of a spectator sport.  I fear too much of this is just going to make wushu look like a big joke.

One thing to think about is how much this is going back to their roots.  Ever watched some of the Old-old school?  They wore some weird crap.  And did some odd tricks.  But, we need to stop and think if that makes it any better.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[The kittens seemed to handle the long hours alone just fine.  I am pretty sure they mostly sleep when we are gone--of course we do still barricade them in the basement if we are gone so it's not like they can get into anything.  Even when we are there to play with them they often prefer to wrestle each other of play with a ball/piece of paper/twisty tie with out our help.  Sometimes I feel a little dissed when they go for the ball over the feather thing on a stick (which used to be like crack to them, they couldn't resist it), but honestly when they get going they are nuts with that little piece of foam.  Like soccer players fed caffeine pills and an IV of Red Bull. Darting across the floor dribbling in a random zig-zag pattern until a final pounce to stop their foe in it's tracks.  Well, at least as much as a foam ball has tracks.

The cats are developing distinctly different personalities.  Ampere is the normal cat. He likes people attention.  Will come up and purr, nuzzle you and be nice when he is getting sleepy.  He also will stop playing and sit still to let you pet him.  Tends to attack things just because he sees them moving.  When at the vet he freaks out and tries to escape, like any good cat should.  He is also about twice as big as Henry, with much softer and thicker fur.

Henry is the odd brother.  Smaller, doesn't like to be handled as much.  Not nearly as trusting for just about anything.  He will run away if you try to pick him up or pet him.  Takes a while to trust a particular toy before he will play with it unless, of course, it is fabric.  Normally he has to see Amp playing with something before he will risk it first person.  He will sit calmly at the vet, or locked up in a cardboard pet carrier.

Don't expect that amp always beats up Henry when they are wrestling.  He might be the smaller, stranger brother, but he is also the smart, sneaky, tricky one too.  For example, I have seen them chasing each other around the room, and Henry is running full speed from Amp and will drop his shoulder to the floor do half a roll so he is on his back looking up and grab Amp as he is running over.  Once latched on he continues to pound that unsuspecting pursuer with his back claws in his little kitten face.  Quite ingenious.

I like our cats.  They are fun.  I don't like the smell of the litter box.  It is not fun.

<hr size="1">
Yes, it's true, I made the team.  Of course it is not the real team, not the team I want to make, but I still made it.  The US Traditional Wushu Team.  Sometimes the word traditional might mean fake.

I preformed alright, not up to my abilities by any means.  My scores were lower than I wanted/expected.  Oh, don't worry I got some great excuses for that.   Or maybe I'll call them points to remember and work on for future competitions.  Nah, they can be excuses.

First my drunken, found out during the line up that the time limit was different that I trained for.  They said 50-90 seconds.  I trained for 60+ seconds.  My form usually ran about 1:49 or so.  Yeah, it's crazy long like that.  So I had people time me and yell "faster" and "finish it"  and "finish it faster"  when I got to about 50 seconds.  I think that happened in the second section.  So I booked it though as much as I could leaving out some of the better combos.  Needless to say my form looked, um, rushed.

For chain whip, well I sat on my whip during them butt hop things.  I had never done those in my silks before.  Silks have the little flap that hangs down in the back, along with the belt--that damn thing got caught in the whip and I wound up sitting on it.  Two or three times.  I was mad.  Real mad.  Later we were evaluating the options for avoiding this problem, we promptly ruled out assless chaps despite the fact that they would eliminate the chain whip butt hop problem.  Bryan pointed out that it might be a good idea to train in my silks <i>before</i> the competition.  I politely called him a jerk and asked him shuddup.

Katherine totally owned everyone with her Fanzi, she was fast and solid--that girl is vicious.  Zack also tore up (the competition, and his lower leg) in ditang, some of those falls had to hurt on that floor.  That very hard unforgiving floor.

Pan Am is where the real deal went down.  Our team did a damn good job, methinks.  I am especially happy that Stephan was able to nail down his gold in sword.  That goes double for Jennifer medaling when she got bumped up as an alternate--her performance was up there with the best.  Jason, Rizqi, Fifi, Jessica, Bee, Alex, everyone on the team tore up.

The tournament was run well, given all the difficulties they (mostly, Kelly, Anita, and Tiantian) were stuck with, they pulled things off amazingly well.  The after party, however, left something to be desired.]]></content:encoded>

And now an Everett memory:

Where is Everett?  I needa call him.  I have an Everett shaped hole in my psycho.  Not psyche, psycho.

<img src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/blog/image/595/mrsnapy.jpg" align="left" />Oh, I saved a turtle from certian death by big suvs in burke yesterday.  On my drive home I noticed a small pile of leaves walking slowly across Lake Braddock--once I decided that leaves don't walk, or have hard outer shells I thougth that turtle was in danger from all the poor drivers in the area.  Teenaged kids soccer moms in trucks.  So I slammed on the brakes, threw it in reverse and jumped out to save Mr. Snappy.  He tried to run, but my moderatly brisk walk enabled me to catch him and haul him back down to the creek.  Honestly, I think he was annoyed.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I did not want to lift today.  But we did.  Stephan and Chad even joked on me that I was late.  It was in my house.  They beat me to the basement.  I was ashamed, as I should be.

Maybe it was because we started plyometrics last night. I may not be ready for that stuff yet.  Serious consideration on putting it off for a wile, any jumping I do will not be sport specific, but the actual sport.  Just wushu jumps. Frog jumps, split-leg jumps, no-arm jumps, etc can wait for a while.  Not sure, the guys might talk me into doing them again, but I think strength conditioning and regular wushu training is what I need for now.

I also need an optional sword.  And more spear practice.  I suck at spear.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I finished my sword form yesterday.  

     We went to lunch with Coach at her husband's restaurant and were talking wushu for a couple of hours.  Which basically got me all psyched up about finishing my sword form, which up to this point was only the opening movements.  So I talked Stephan (who had trained once that day with Chad) into coming over and watching wushu vids for a little while before we went to train.  All sword and spear stuff.  Once we had a few ideas we ran over to the school to try and put a form together.  With Stephan's help I was able to finish the entire thing. That man is a crazy natural sword form maker-upper. He has so many different, and cool, movements in his sword vocab that he can just pull one out at anytime for anything.  [I added in a combo from Shi Kun](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/vine/showthread.php?t=350407), plus some other stuff that has been butchered so much that I am certain the athletes that originally made it up could not tell. 

     Overall I am really happy with my form.  Between Me, Stephan and Sara we were able to make a pretty original form.  Now I just gotta get my 720 tornado to horse stance that I need for it.  And 540 jump outside.  And double sweep.  Aiya.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[O-Mei was twisting.

 I am crazy proud of the boys last night.  Everyone, I mean everyone did a butterfly twist in class.  How many schools can pull that off.  I know it was in advanced class, but it's not like it was a super small class of just the 'good' people.  We had 3 people try them for the first time, and everyone made it around.  Ain't pretty, but it was a full 360, with a actual landing.  High energy, everyone pushing hard.  See for your self: [Rock, rock on.](http://homepage.mac.com/fuzzymonk/.Movies/omeitwists.mpg)

 While everyone was butterfly twistin, stepahan pusted out an aerial twist.  Then I <b>had</b> to, so I got up the nerve, said a little prayer, grunted a little and went for it. Jump, pull, twist, BAM!  But'but'it was my feet that made the bam.  I was psyched; I did a dozen or so.  Need to do more today.  I just hope I don't have to get al psyched up again today, cause that takes a lot of time and effort. Again: [Rock, rock on.](http://homepage.mac.com/fuzzymonk/.Movies/chrisareialtwist.mpg)

 We let the kittens have the run of the house last night. It was the first night they were not locked up in the basement.  I thought I might wake up to the sound of crashing glass from downstairs.  Really I just woke up to Henry pouncing on the folds in the blankets on the bed.  The slept with us the entire night.  Mostly curled up close to Kelly, be it in the crevice of a knee pit or by her back or in her death grip snuggle hold.  Surprisingly enough Kelly would sort of wake up, roll over-smushing a kitten-who would wiggle free and find another spot near her to lie down.  Her heat hemorrhage is quite the lure for the feline persuasion.  They kept me up a little but I was restless to begin with, defiantly worth it for the mao-purr thing when I first came to bed.

 I am not such a fan of a cat nuzzling up to my face, then sneezing all over me.  Yeah.  That's no so cute.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[We took the kittens for  their second visit to the vet today.  Much easier with two people there to handle them.  Our vet was caught up in a bit of an emergency so we were in the little waiting room for a little while.  They did the normal suspicious exploring, but Henry took it one step further by licking the soap.  Not a bar of soap, but that the soft-serve pump liquid hand soap. He was licking like crazy and making faces for a while.  He then proceeded to produce copious amounts of drool.  I took a tissue and wiped the drool off only to be have a cat that started to foam at the mouth.  Not like a normal "barking dog" type foaming, but more like hand dishwashing liquid in a dishwashing machine.  Once I wiped his whole mouth out with a tissue a few times (leaving little clumps of tissue stuck on his cat like tongue) he seemed to return to normal.

The shots and other medicine that followed were totally uneventful.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Saturday training was demo practice only--getting ready for the Ode to Peace demo next weekend.  A number of us didn't even get the luxury of a proper warm up, we just went straight for the sword set.  The demo does have a few cool things to it, for example we are doing a number of group fighting sets, not too many group forms. Actual real fighting sets.  The guy that was brought in is an old Peking Opera guy, and seems to know his stuff, of course he is also a little overly picky, and alot of my classmates are getting very annoyed at him and his, um, techniques.  I got to the point where he was making unnecessary demands on my group.  Basically the rest of my Spear/double broadsword group had learned the set, but I was being brouth in to replace someone who won't be able to make it to the demo.  Well, he wanted us to show him the set before I had even had the chance to walk though it, I on the other hand decided that I must walk though it first.  Funny thing is everyone else who disagreed with this fella got met with a sharp <i>no, do it my way</i> reply (well, the Chinese equivalent at least), but my belligerent and somewhat pushy, <i>no, we must  practice it first</i> was answered only with a <i>sorry</i>.  At first I was just buzzing on the i-put-this-guy-in-his-place feeling, but once I actually thought about it decided that I didn't want to project that image.  Not that I think in hindsight that I should've done it differently, but more like, I will try really hard to perform at a higher level than this guy expected.  Basically I decided that if I am going to be a pain in the ass about doing something I better do a damn good job of it (know what the hell I am talking about or shutup).

You can also factor in the fact that I was annoyed that I didn't get to train any optional stuff, i.e. the stuff we needa work on now.

<img src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/blog/image/595/liveonpenn.jpg" align="right" />Once training was over Kelly and I headed downtown to Live on Penn.  $7 for a TMBG show.  We also got to hear Fountains of Wane, but other than <i>Stacy's Mom</i> I was somewhat disinterested in them.  TMBG was fun, and a good thing too it was Kelly's first Giants show.  They didn't seem to do as many of their little gimmicks, like whip out the radio and play along, or that giant stick thing, pretty much a normal rock show.  Not a bad thing, but I have come to expect more from them.  Or they.

<img src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/blog/image/595/joshcake.jpg" align="left" />Went home and crashed, only to wake up still very groggy and drive to Richmond.  In fact I was so out of it that Kelly drove us.  It rained, and was dreary.  I wanted to sleep.  Kelly even claimed that I was sleeping with my eyes open for a while.  I crashed on the couch at the 'rents, until I was drug to Laura's house for the birthday party.  And, with Joshua turning 1 it was a par-tay.  I had way too many taquitos.  Jacob and I played.  Everyone ate cake and we had a great time.  Joshua ate his cupcake from the bottom up.  Ending in a glorious icing implosion.

<img src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/blog/image/595/gasstationcologne.jpg" align="right"  />We drove home.  I had to stop and use the facilities at exit 104 on I95.  Fun fact: at the first gas station off the north bound exit ramp you can buy a squirt of cologne for 25 cents.  I however, didn't invest in it.

<i>It rained.  All Weekend.</i>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Ode to Peace was insane.  I had never done that demo before; everyone told me that it was crazy every year.  I had no idea how dehydrated I would get.  I was hot, sunny and hot.  Found out we were going on 3 times, over 3 hours.  Originally it was supposed to be over 2 hours, but things ran slowly and acts kept arriving late.  Sitting smack out in front of the Jefferson Memorial next to the tidal basin, the announcers kept making really, really ridicusoly bad jokes for the people in paddle boats.  I would ask anyone around me to make the announcers never talk again.

We did basics, we did our group set.  We didn't get to do the stuff we are actually good at, i.e. our forms.  I was supposed to do drunken and jiujiebain, but after the second demo I was dehydrated and hypoglycemic. So I told coach I didn't feel good and left.  At first I felt really bad for bailing.  This was especially bad because I scolded some of the kids, with a if you commit to something then you need to do it.  If you cannot commit then you need to say so.  But as I thought about it all the planning that had been done was thrown out the window and they changing everything, not to mention the fact that no one had bothered to disclose to me what we were doing in the first place, I had no idea it was going to be doing demo stuff from 1 till 7.  I became very frustrated, which was appropriate in the sweltering heat and humidity.

Stephan said it was just the Maryland kids for the last demo anyway.

I did feel a little bad for all our friends that came out, I really hoped it was going to be a good show for them to watch, and based on the information I had in the week leading up to it I thought it was gonna be.  They hung out till I was done, met us back at our house; we grabbed some steak for dinner and played caps well into the night.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Quick week in review.

Basically I have been stressing about a stupid problem at work, it's one of those things that no matter what I do, no matter how far I get if it don't work, it don't work.  I have been driving a sucky drive the past few days into the client for most of the day only to come home and dial into the home office to check some other stuff, that might, but probably won't help me with this @#$% piece of @#$!

In other words I haven't been training much, and tonight on my anniversary I came home and went to sleep at about quarter to six.  Of course I got up at 10 or so, had some serial, put Kelly to bed and came up here to encode video and tinker with Solaris version 5.suck.my-ass.

The highlight of the week was Tom's getting' married happy hour.  We went to Dr. Dremo in Arlington, which may very well be my new favorite bar inside the beltway.  Outside the beltway I prefer Hokie House.  And besides the fun and drinking (and fun drinking) with co-workers the best part of that was giving Tom his wedding present.  Wrapped up it totally look like it could be another place setting of china or wine goblets, and tom was totally expecting to get that slap in the face that is a Croft and Barrel box; but no, we totally surprised him with a shiny new PS2.  I had told people that we couldn't get him something boring off the registry and once he had opened it and become unspeachless'd he said he was totally expecting something boring off the registry.  Consumer electronics 1.  House wares 0.

I think my back is bleeding.  Cats were wrestling on my chair and one decided to use some sort of jumping attack that used my back as a spring board. Stingy.

I am going to give up on work/video/blogging and all the other geek activitys for the night now and go to bed and read my geek book.  Damn you [Neal Stephenson](http://www.nealstephenson.com/), why must I think you are so cool, which makes you uncool and thus I am more of a social disgrace.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Shin splints are back and in force. That coupled with the tired leg ache thing I get when I am tired didn't lead to a fun weekend for my lower extremities. Saturday we had a kick ass class, coach was coaching and teaching and everything we wanted, pushed us all hard, which resulted in me being pooped. We ran up to Todd's place to see everyone (and to my surprise he had a huge gathering of our VT buddies there), then came home changed clothes and went out to DuPont with McHugh and Co. Shuffleboard fun for everyone. It was lots of fun, but I was dead tired when we showed up at Todd's place, by 1 am when we were on the metro home I wasn't so perky.

Weak legs from training + painful achy legs from being tired = no fun walking up the escalator at DuPont.

<img src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/wushu/082004Photoshoot/photoshootwushu/image/595/O_Mei_Wushu_Park_51.jpg" align="left" /></a>Friday Stephan and I were left to our own devices at wushu, we had Duanne stop by and take some more pictures, not of me this time, but he did a bunch for Stephan and Sarah. I am thinking Stephan actually wanted them and Sarah got tricked into it because the photographer wanted them. I heard they were there till midnight shooting stuff. I felt bad because I though Kelly was gonna be at Jeannie's, but she didn't go because she worked till 8 and figured I would be home soon. I stayed late working on sword, never heard the phone ring. Poor girl she has had a stressful week at work-and so have I-so neither one of us could really be there for each other as we were both stressed to the limit.

To the limit.  2da limit.

<hr />

Last night, after I had stayed up till 1:45 making the 2004 Chang Quan China National Qualifier VCD I went downstairs to check it out. I was sitting right in front of the TV, with the door the the entertainment center open so I could push the buttons on the DVD player. Amp walked over, sniffed the glass in the door, ducked under it and headed downstairs. I continued to flip through the tracks on the VCD and then there came a duh-da-da duh-da-da of a kitten sprinting up the stairs rounding the corner (as best he can on the hardwood floor, jumping over my leg and smacking face first into the glass door. He immediately did an about face and tore down the stairs. I found him hiding in the basement, and he completely flinched when I tried to pick him up, but he seemed fine.

That, however, is not as funny as when Sean asked us if we noticed that one of the kittens smelled bad. I got worried, thinking it was something to do with his allergies or a kitten was sick. But no, turns out he went to use the facilities late after we all had gone to bed and while he was in there one of the cats decided to come in and visit him. Well, between the time Sean finished his business and flushing the toilet curiosity set in and the cat jumped up on the commode to see what all the fuss was about. Normally, the lid would be shut, as Kelly has taken it upon her self to do everything in her power to prevent toilet related kitten drownings, but this time was different. The cat landed with it's front two paws right in the bowl. Sean claims to have said/thought "what are you doing!?" as he grabbed the cat up and drug it over to the sink for a unpleasant (for the cat, as we can deduct to his behavior) rinsing of the paws. Luckily the combination of forced front paw sink-cleaning and the instinctual self-cleaning of the cat neither one has any noticeable odor.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[The big drive with jason, day 3. 200 Miles to De Moines.  That's a lot of corn.

<img src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/blog/image/595/iowawelcome.jpg" align="center" />

Chicago was crazy and crazy fun.  We rolled into Erik's place, well I think it may have been Erik and Rob's place, but I am pretty sure Danny said Rob doesn't live there--which seemed a little odd because he defiantly seemed to be living there as far as I could tell.  We met everyone and settled into the ultimate bachelor pad, complete with full bar and Golden Tee machine.  They even had table tents with the specials and appetizers.

Jason and I decided to opt for the couches in the bar.  The living room couch was pretty comfy, but people were up longer they we wanted to be, so we went down stairs for sleepin'.  I know we could have gone and slept on the couch in the kitchen, but that was just a little to new and different for us in the trip.

Next morning we headed down jumped on the El and rumbled into America's other city.  It's pretty dang easy to find the cubs game.  It's where everybody gets off the train.  We wondered around Wrigley for a while taking pictures of Jason.  He may not have looked excited but that man was as lost to giddy as he could be.  Found our seats, which were right smack behind a big steel post.  Apparently the guy who sold us the tickets failed to mention that on eBay. Cubs won 2 to zip over the Dodgers.

<img src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/blog/image/595/sears.jpg" align="left" />While we waited for the crows to die down on the way out of the stadium we whipped out the map and tried to figure out what to do and where to go.  Decided to just wonder downtown, wound up near Millennium Park, took a peak at it and then made our way to the Sears Tower. I got my picture taken with a big group of kids, they seemed pretty happy that I joined in on the photo fun.

194 to De Moines.

About that time we ran into Big Papa, ask around, everyone knows him.  He gave us some advice on where to go, and what to eat.  Then Jason gave him a dollar to go away.  We didn't follow his advice.

On our way to to check out that famous fountain near the Chicago river we did get to experience some interesting examples of parenting.  The first one we noticed a small family of four, and the mother was asserting to the father that he only sould praise their son when he does something good instead of scolding him when he does something bad.  Their son meanwhile, had wondered off moping and hit behind a bush.  The bush was about 5' high and well manicured to have a slightly rounded Christmas tree shape.  I knew and opportunity when I saw it.  So I joined him by going to mope behind the neighboring tree.  He looked at me, eyes red teary, I just pressed my finger to my lips and made that shhhh sound.

In retrospect I should waited him out.  I didn't I left first, he left once I was gone, but I really think I would have been a better help had I waited him out.  Also should have had Jason scold me with a "you can't have another icecream, you'll spoil your dinner!" Now we know for when we see the next kid moping behind a bush.

The next instance of parenting technique occurred immediately after that, the next group of people we happened upon infact.  This was a mother alone with her 4 kids.  They seemed much better behaved and responded almost instantly when their mother asked them to get away from a fountain.  "Get you    ass back here, I's gonna smack you in da head!"  Clearly a more effective approach.

The most exciting thing in Chicago was the helicopter that happened to appear a few block ahead of us between a couple of the skyscrapers.  That was cool.

Our feet hurt, we caught a movie (we are in Iowa now!) in a skyscraper, Manchurian Candidate.  Missed the red line and walked all the way back to the Chicago River from the lake. Went back to the car, got lost trying to find the house. Got some OJ at a Jewl Osco and crashed.  Some reason Jason let me sleep till quarter of 11.  And now we are on the road again.

I only got a couple of more days, Jason has a month and a half.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I didn't realize how much I really miss everyone.  I got real nostalgic, and wanted the good old days again. I wanted to go back to I could hang out with everyone again.  I saw people who were once so close just give me that polite-to-strangers feel.  It's depressing.  I feel like if I were to go back it would be like it was.  But I know it won't. It can't.  Aiya.

[At this point someone slaps me across my face and I snap out if it]

Seeing them all again was so nice, hanging out, talking about doing stuff ' we were talking about making a movie again.  One last film before something drastic happens like people moving to LA.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<b>Dean's Place</b>

Crashed in KC with dean.  He is just moving in to his new place, which was a little odd because the boys in Chicago were moving out, but had plenty of room--including a couch and an air mattress.  I wanted to meet up with some of his wushu fellas out there but Jason was ancy to get to Colorado, and who could blame him, so we rolled out once we got up.  Laurance was an interesting town, like a big Blacksburg, or maybe what Charlottesville is like. We got to see all the KU freshmen milling around the student center with their bags of free crap. We also had an enlightening drive by the humongous frat houses just off campus.  $4 Million craziness.

<b>Kansas, Taco John's and girl</b>

From Dean's place we had the length of Kansas to drive across.  Western Kansas is a wasteland barren of all cell phone signal.  But there was a Taco John's.  We stopped and ate some tacos, a quesadilla and some potato oles.  While the oles were intriguing the girl behind the counter got more of our attention.  Nothing crazy, she just was some cute farmer girl that had this tendency to hold eye contact a little too long when she gave you your food and thanked you for coming to Taco John's. The extended gaze and extra heartfelt "thanks" had an eerie subliminal cry for help.  Jason decided that he should of taken her to California.  Unfortunately he didn't deiced this until we were down the road a ways.

<b>World's largest prairie dog</b>

<img src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/blog/image/595/prairiedogtown.jpg" class="center" />

Western Kansas is full of some strange things.  Nothing we saw was stranger than the place advertising the world's larges prairie dog.  They also bragged about the Live 6 legged steer, 5 legged steer, Roscoe the miniature donkey and live badgers. Something like 300 animals.  We stopped.  We went in.  They wanted six bucks.  We left.  They wouldn't even let us into the gift shop unless we paid.  Quote of the week was man that was sitting next to Peggy Hill (the assumed owner and proprietor of prairie dog land) who upon us turning down their offer claimed "a six legged cow is worth that alone!"

I made eye contact with a couple of guys going in as we were driving away.  They laughed in shame.

<img src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/blog/image/595/prairiedogtown2.jpg" class="center" />

<b>Colorado</b>

<img src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/blog/image/595/coloradobatido.jpg" class="center" />

Colorado was marked with the best state sign we had encountered so far.  There was a little pull off, a trash can and even a speed limit sign upping our max speed to 75.  We were able to get some fun pictures like handstands and au batidos. We knew we liked Colarado already.

About 15 minutes later we were a bit annoyed that Colorado was still as flat as Kansas.

<b>Getting to the Rockies</b>

A lot more minutes later we were much happier when we got to the mountains.  The rocky mountains.  Jason drove around with his mouth gaping open staring up at the ridges.  We like this place.  But after western Kansas we woulda liked most places.

Olympic Training Center

<img src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/blog/image/595/coloradootc.jpg" class="center" />

Wrigley Field is to Jason as the Olympic Training Center is to me.  I want to go live there.  I made Jason go back the next day because we missed all the tours for that day.

<img src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/blog/image/595/coloradootc2.jpg" class="center" />

<b>Scary camp ground</b>

We decided we needed to find a place to sleep on Colorado Springs.  This is Colorado, so there must be plenty of camping to be had.  We found a campground guide at the Colorado welcome center, with my powers of looking at campground listings found one near Pikes Peak that was a mere $14 a night.  So we went there.  The overgrown oddly spaced out playground equipment alone was enough to frighten us.  Once we made a quick lap around the grounds Jason offered up the idea or returning to a hotel.  That travel lodge may have been $50 a night, but that shower and crappy bed were so nice.

<b>Hiking</b>

We did pull off on some random trail for a little hiking.  Felt great after the driving.  Fun to hike though the red dirt and cacti.  However it was late in the day, got dark, we started talking about how "Two young men from Virginia were last seen on a trail near Colarado Springs..." sounded to plausible.  We headed back to the Travel Lodge.

<b>Pikes Peak</b>

<img src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/blog/image/595/coloradoflattire.jpg" align="left" />Pikes Peak bright and early.  Well, not early enough for us to get the free breakfast, but was plenty early to get that flat tire.  And hour after we noticed the tire we were at the gate to the Pikes Peak toll road, deciding we didn't' have enough gas we went back into town and promptly cam back to the toll road and headed up the mountain. We was Picas in a rock outcropping--they were these big chipmunk like creatures.  Followed promptly by the yellow bellied marmots that came up to the car.  Never saw any bighorn mountain sheep, but were overall happy with our wildlife encounters.

<img src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/blog/image/595/coloradopica.jpg" class="center" />

Walking around on the summit would make me lightheaded.  I said  "I am feeling woosy" in a strongsad voice way more times than it was funny.  Most queasy I got was when I set up the camera on timer and ran to get in the shot.  Standing up on that big rock there.

<img src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/blog/image/595/pikespeakrock.jpg" class="center" />

<img src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/blog/image/595/pikespeaksign.jpg" class="center" />

<b>Gummy at the Rockies game</b>

<img src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/blog/image/595/rockiesgame.jpg" align="left" />On to Denver, and onto another baseball game.  Coors field and the Rockies were playing the Mets.  I am pretty sure there were more Mets fans there. The Rockies did have the support of old Gummy.  This lady, who Jason and I dubbed Gummy, was sitting in the row in front of us, and never once stopped talking. Told me how she didn't like burned hotdog as she pealed the overcooked portions of the frank off, and continued to expound on the subject it as she chewed.   Eventually her portly son with a stylish braided rattail poking out from under his backwards ball cap returned with his poor, poor girlfriend.  Apparently he had taken her to the first aid stand because she got something in her eye. Gummy would give her input on how she thought a bug flew in and bit that poor girl's eye.  When she finished telling the bug in the eye theory, with no topic to move onto she would promptly restart telling the bug in the eye theory.  Sometimes she would move away to a different topic like how she liked beer more than pop, but would only go back to the bug in the eye discourse.

We wound up watching the game from the food stand promenade.

<b>Denver Airport</b>

Now I sit in the Denver airport after a nice relaxing night in the Motel 6, which by the way is cheaper than that Super 8. We didn't chance single rate for fear that we wouldn't get the double beds, but the extra $3 was worth the peace of mind.  Fun thing about the Denver airport is that the Chinese food is available for breakfast, and just like in china there is not specific breakfast food, just normal Chinese food.  Kung Pao Ji at 9 a.m. what could be better.

Frontier Airlines makes you pay for TV.  You get a free sandwich, but you have to pay for TV.  I say, lemme pay for food and give me TV free, dammit.  It's the American way!]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Work is sucky, lets not think about that.

I have been lifting more as of late.  The boys have been bailing on me as Stephan is working on the mornings now, but I have been able to keep up with the frequency of lifting days so far.  I have been coming in to the office and lifting here, which is nice because I can do more things.  It is not nice because I don't have lifting buddies.  Well, if I am lucky one of my coworkers is in there too, but they like to lift too early.  A spotter would be nice, but I can always dump the weights if it comes to that.

Oh, speaking of dumping the weights.  I was doing squats--no, I didn't actually dump them but I thought I might need to--I can dead lift more than I can squat these days.  Perhaps I am just not used to it.  Perhaps I just didn't feel as safe.

The best part of lifting in at the office is a pull-up bar.  I don't have one at home, so I pulled at wushu.  Wushu doesn't have a bar I can use, so we use the I-beam for pulls and hanging leg raises (kick that bar!) which rips your hands up.  I get all these strange bruises on  my finger joints and odd hand callous action.

I trained today, over lunch.  I mostly went so I could talk to coach as I hadn't been to wushu much this week because of a combination of my heel social obligations.  Hmm, did I mention that I had a mysterious heel pain when I wear shoes?  Only when I wear shoes.  So I spend a lot time walking on the back of my left shoe, like a slip-on.

Lucas showed, and that made training much better than it woulda been.  Since coach wasn't there I was defaulted into running class, but I sorta dogged that by saying "sections," and we just did jumps and sections the entire time.  I had intended on doing sword, but that got trumped when everyone else was busting tricks.  So I did tricks too.  Once I got psyched up I hardly noticed the nasty medicinie feel that my decongestant provided.

The real fun was last night, old school wushu reunion.  A number of us don't even train anymore.  Crazy nice to see everyone again and hang out.  Glenn, Suzie, Sarah, Paulo, Melinie+1, Vyvy and us.  Those guys rock.  Mel was round.  Kelly was supposed to be round with her.  Probably woulda been if we had stayed as close as we used to be.  Not that we all have grown apart, when we met up it was like no time had passed.  Everyone was still the same person they were before.  Twice in one week.  Good times.

" 'Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind'; and, 'Love your neighbor as yourself.'
Luke [10:27](http://www.biblegateway.com/cgi-bin/bible?passage=LUKE+10&language=english&version=NIV)

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Well, I didn't train last night.  But I was very productive.  I accomplished two main things.  1) Fixed the toilet in the Men's bathroom and 2) Made a present for Kelly and her Mom.

Reverse order.

Can't talk about the present because then Kelly would know.

The toilet was amazingly disgusting.  It was leaking around the wax seal on the floor.  So it was leaking <i>after</i>.  We had been trying to keep everything clean by moping up in there, but you could only do but so much.  The smell was becoming not so subtle. When I pulled up the toilet I even discovered a few, lets call them, bugs.  Picture this.  You snap on your latex gloves.  Mop the floor.  Wipe down the toilet with Lysol disinfectant wipes. Unscrew the bolts.  Yank up a stinky toilet, splashing water everywhere (the plunger was old, busted, and didn't work).  A nasty brown waxy ring of poo was on the floor around the sewage pipe.  And to my delight a dozen small, fast, nasty bugs ran and scurried around the floor.  I whacked a few with a rolled up newspaper, but to my further delight it didn't even faze them.  I was forced to lay the newspaper on top of them and punch it profusely.

Eventually I got the new seal on and the toilet properly shimmed up and the first round of calking finished.  I will add extra.  Must contain the poo.  And the poo related stink.  I must have mopped the floor 15 time yesterday.  Waxy feces is my new arch enemy.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Bursitis. In my heel.  Sonofabitch.

WebMD says:<blockquote> Bursitis is inflammation of a bursa, a small sac of fluid that cushions and lubricates an area between tendon and bone or around a joint. The inflammation can cause the bursa to swell with fluid. Bursitis can occur anywhere in the body where there is a bursa, usually near a joint. The condition is often painful. <a href="http://my.webmd.com/hw/health_guide_atoz/tn3727.asp?lastselectedguid={5FE84E90-BC77-4056-A91C-9531713CA348}" border="0"><img src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/blog/image/595/bursa.jpg" class="center" /></a></blockquote>But anything that doesn't irritate it is A-OK according to the Doc.  Dr. Miliani is my favorite wahoo.  Him and Tom, but only because Tom called me and wants me to pull a basketball hoop out of the ground with my jeep.  And that sounds like it will be as much fun as cutting up a swing set with a chainsaw.

Oh, and I showed Kelly her present.  It's an [online cookbook](http://cookbook.fuzzymonk.com/).]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Arg, I don't know what is up with my heel.  The mass doses of ibuprofen definatlly seem to help, but I can't wear normal shoes.  Now I am not entirely sure I can't, I just walk around a little and it feels strange, maybe a little bit of pain and I freak out and take them off as to not aggravate it any.  I can, however, wear feiyues that have been cut on the heel and then taped back onto my foot with no discomfort at all.  I have been doing that to old worn-out pairs of shoes, I may modify a new(ish) pair soon because I am getting annoyed at the holes in the sole.

Everyone is getting aerial twist.  Stoppit, that's my move.

I am mad at Kevin Smith.  I think I paid $30 for my Clerks DVD the first time around.  I paid 2/3s that for the 10th anniversary edition. But I didn't want to buy it again, and he had to go and make a DVD set that a had to buy.  I can't wait to see the ABC's of no budget film making.

To summarize: You can call me jumpin' bean.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I find my self stressing about work.  I have been her over a year, but in the past that is about as long as I stay at a job before they give me the "it's not you it's me" speech.

Prolly just paranoid.

Today at lunch I decided that when I have kids I need to replace the word <i>ut-oh</i> with something more interesting.  Ben suggested <i>formaldehyde</i>.  So every time the baby dropped something they would say <i>formaldehyde</i>!  That way when they play the I'm gonna make daddy pick up stuff game they love to play it will at least be interesting for the unsuspecting by-standers.

I feel there is no need to point out that we watched a young boy in a stroller drop a set keys repeatedly while chanting "ut-oh."

Heel, heel go away.  I am really annoyed today.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[We can't go to the picnic.  Those selfish condescending lil _____.  I just want to play volleyball and have a hotdog with everyone else.

Tonight is going to be an interesting mix of juggling cars, wushu, gymnastics and going home to get stuff for the cars, wushu and gymnastics.  I havn't been to the gym since the beginning of summer, and I can't go next week, so I really otta make a point of doing some flipping tonight, but it is not really convenient.  Getting up early, going to woodbridge, finding a way home sans car.  I am gonna be tired tonight.  Don't expect to be home till after 11.

I even ditched wushu and watched 4 episodes of stargate.  I am ashamed.   My real excuse is physical injuries, primarily my inability to look left.  Yes, I tried to do kip ups before I was warmed up, pulled something in my neck.  Now I am a unilooker.

Chipotle time.

<i>Update:  We coulda gone, and we coulda played, but we didn't buy tickets.  Woulda cut in on our cash for other less fun activities.  Bah.</i>]]></content:encoded>

Ivan is just skirting cancun.

Well, kelly was in richmond so she was staying the the marriot down there.  being the opertunistic lady she is, she asked about the marriot in cancun we will be staying at.  To, ya know, see if it is still there.  It sure is, and alot of people are canceling their trips because of the hurricane--dispite the fact that it will be just fine by this weekend. According to weather.com at least.  They are calling for a few thunder storms at first, but then it is looking like 94 and clear skies.  Woot.

<img src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/blog/image/595/timberlandclogs.jpg" class="center" /> Thanks to the bursitis I am now wearing man clogs.  I never wear shoes with out a back. Now, I have made the jump to <i>man clogs</i>.  Aiya.

Coach harassed me saying I tak alot of vacations last night.  Sure we booked this one when I was making that big drive with jason, but seriously, it is the only other non-weekend trip I have made this year.

Sword sucked.  I am feelin' awkward in my optional sword.  I think it needs some tweeking, it's just so furstrating.  However coach was ripping us up.  It's nice to have coach back, with a Stephon kicker.  Yeah, it's true I got to work late today because I was up at 1:30 in the morning watching wushu videos.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I went and trained at 11 today.  It was jsut me and chad.  Coach gave me some really good corrections.  I was having trouble with this vertical behind the back flower movement in my new jian form.  I really can't believe that I suck at that movement so badly.  It seems so basic.  Well if I can nail the flavor for that stuff I will rock the form.  One good thing about having a coach who specilized in the same event that I do.

Chad got yelled at for marking up the big logo, she asked him who did it when we first walked in and he fessed up rigth away.  I think coach was stunned because she was thinking it was someone else entirely, but she smack his hands with one of those chinese fans and scoleded him.

Note: Never paint a giant logo on the wall using black chinese ink.  If someone gets all hyper and jumps up to slap it it will leave streaks on the wall.  It also stinks.

Kelly had to email ben and have him punch me because she couldn't get in touch with me today.  I felt like a jerk.  Much like I felt like a jerk when I didn't make it to gymnastics last night and sean did.  I called him and swore up and down that I would honestly go fo-sho, and well, for the umpteenth time I didn't.

Some of the wushu ren wanna go out after class.  But then they started mentioning a hooka bar and I got skeptical.  I have to fly out early-early in the morning so that may not work.  Perhaps we can just get sean to come hang out as we prep for cancun.

I forgot my shoes and I am wearing feiyues to work.  I tend to do more kicks in the office if I am wearing my wushu shoes.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[We are getting ready to go on vacation so I participated in the laundry duties, not too much, but I was helping.  So I go downstairs and unload the dryer into a hamper full of clean clothes.  Really have to stuff it down good to make it fit well enough to haul upstairs.  Once upstairs I opt for the dump it out in the middle of the floor method.  I figure the highly compressed clothes down at the bottom would be otherwise winkled far past acceptable, um, wrinkledge. It's a nice neat pile, maybe twice as high as it is wide.  Taking up very little floor space in the living room.

I run off to deal with other duties such as adding the much needed freshly clean drawers to my take-on-vacation clothes pile upstairs.  I shut the door behind me to prevent the cats from getting in to the bedroom.

 When I go downstairs I discover why it was such a good idea to shut the door.  The pile has lost all it's verticalness in lieu of horizontalness.  It was spread out over half the floor.  Around the Ikea chairs and foot rest, around (and a little on) the Foof.  And there was a very proud looking kitten sitting upright right in the middle of the chaos.   Henry was looking so prim and proper, like he did me the favor of killing all the mean clothes.

I gave him a treat.]]></content:encoded>

Nest best thing is the pool with a bar in it.  The pool has a bar in it.  Great idea.  White sand, warm ocean.  I am not going to go home.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Tomorrow we return home.  Pfftt.  At home kelly dosn't get a random assortment of sunburn stripes.  And we can't get hamburgers and froofy drinks in the pool.

Eastland and Harry's (aka Isla Mujares) and Chicken Pizza (Chichen Itza) make this place really cool.

Too many First Fitness people bragging about how great their wares are and how we sould join the cult.

Paying for internet sucks, so I get back to this later.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I am going to the podiatrist today for my heel.  I feel a bit like a fake, because it doesn't really hurt.  If I don't wear any shoes with a back to them I don't notice at all, so the week in flip-flops was pain free.  I am actually wearing heel'd shoes today, but they are not a pair that I had ever verified to actually cause pain before, so I don't know if I *should* be feeling any pain now or not.  So it A) May be all better and I am being too cautious to test it out or B) may not be any better but not cause any pain because I am babying it so much.

Rahhh!  So I will just do what the doctor said and get it looked at again, even though it don't really bug me.  <i>Don't really!</i>

One, two, three ... go back to Mexico!

Dammit, still here.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last night Kelly made me watch football instead of Monday night stargate.  Eventually she went up stairs and fell asleep leaving me downstairs alone to watch the game.  I coulda watched stargate, but at that point I was into the game and had to finish it.  Up past midnight watching pro ball and our team lost.  Stupid professionals.

The fun part was when Kelly showed up to wushu after she working out/shopping.  I happened to be standing outside unsuccessfully trying to break into a car with a coat hanger.  We went back into wushu and I trained a little more while she told me how hungry she was.  Eventually she drove Jennifer home and I stopped at Xi Shang Fan for some tasty gan bian si ji duo and gung pao ji (bu ma ti).  They didn't put in the ma ti so I was a happy guy.

Right now I want some Chinese food so I am not thinking of how bad my front sweeps sucked last night.  At least I did an aerial twist.

Three cheers for tivo! Buh-doop Ba-doop Bi-dip!]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I took the tickle.com IQ test and got a 133. It said:<blockquote>Your IQ score is 133

This number is based on a scientific formula that compares how many questions you answered correctly on the Classic IQ Test relative to others.

Your Intellectual Type is Visual Mathematician. This means you are gifted at spotting patterns — both in pictures and in numbers. These talents combined with your overall high intelligence make you good at understanding the big picture, which is why people trust your instincts and turn to you for direction — especially in the workplace. And that's just some of what we know about you from your test results. </blockquote>
And then from [here](http://aistis.raudys.name/iq.html)[:](http://cgi.eaglecentre.force9.co.uk/blog/archives/000295.php)<blockquote>Average: 85 - 115
Above average: 116 - 125
Gifted Borderline Genius: 126 - 135
Highly gifted and appearing to be a Genius to most others: 136 - 145
Genius: 146 - 165
High Genius: 166 - 180
Highest Genius: 181 - 200
Beyond being measurable Genius: Over 200</blockquote>Why must everything I do be so damn borderline.  Oh, I know, it's cause I take online  IQ tests.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Monday my cd player on the jeep started acting up.  First I noticed that the CD I cue’d up the night before to 99 Red Balloons didn't kick in until I was pulling out of my neighborhood.  Then when I switched back to the radio a nice feedback screech slowly built up.  The funnest part was when it decided to blink on and off as fast as it could.  The head unit does this cute little "hello" on startup and "see you" on power off.  Well, it decided it would have fun with s sequence lika thisa:

Hello see you see you see you see you hello see you see you see you hello see you hello

So I disassembled the jeep yesterday to find the loose wire.  I thought it was the ground.  When my last radio got stolen the original ground wire was yanked clean out.  Not knowing where the wire went I decided to just ground the radio to the frame.  So I was thinking that ground point was not a clean connection. I left the radio on toe debug and started jiggling.  Wires.  I jiggled wires.  The only thing that made any difference was by pushing the connecter into the back of the head unit.  If I pushed real hard everything behaved.  This didn't seem right, because I had made the wiring harness and had a little ad hoc ground solution.  But I wiggled and jiggled those thingys to no effect. I even completely disconnected the ground, yeah, the radio don't needa be grounded at all.  Go figure.

So my jeep is still disassembled and I will try the original factory radio tonight.  If that works, well, then I get to bust out the mixed tapes from high school.  Cassette tapes roxorz.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Unforeseen side effects of relandscaping the front yard:<ul>   <li>Meeting a lot of our neighbors.</li>   <li>Thumb blisters</li>   <li>Delayed onset thumb soreness (I'm having a hard time turning the steering wheel) </li>   <li>Tracking mud into the back of the Jetta</li>   <li>33% extra</li>   <li>Bathroom tile</li> </ul> Well, so some of those shouldn't have been unexpected. However I didn't expect them, or at least never thought about them. Kelly ripped up half of half the yard on Friday (yeah, I coulda said a quarter), but the real work got going on Saturday. We yanked up most of the flox with that little hand spade/fork thingy, which was surprisingly effective. Kelly's dad showed armed with kick ass hand matic, and his ho. He also has a nice green lawn chair so he could supervise properly, however he couldn't stay out of the action and joined in with the fun. I think it was because we kept finding the bathroom tile that a former owner planted. Or maybe it was the toy Jeep we discovered. We also unearthed a tiny snake, a family of salamanders and a bunch of crickets and spiders. Science fair project: the eco system in our front yard.

Sean brought Jason, who claimed to be sitting around bored, and they had his little truck with him (as per our request). Which once we were finished dismantling the landscaping timbers (as per Kelly's request) we took it to Merrifield Garden Center and loaded it up with stone dust and a bunch of sod. We loaded it up so much that the poor little truck leaned way back, tires bulged and it fishtailed when driven down the road. I followed them in Kelly's car saying aloud "Just a little slower, a little slower, Sean--take it easy. Slower…" But we made it back to the house.

Once we got the dirt rearranged to my liking we started laying down the sod. We were about 80% covered when we looked up and noticed that the truck was only about 50% empty. After some lengthy arithmetic and fractions I deduced that we had extra. So we laid the rest. Got irritable and cursed while laying the large slate stepping stones. Oh, I totally blame Ben for the broken one in the middle. Sure I was the one that dropped it when it broke, but he was near by and had a shifty look about him.

We hauled the extra sod into the back yard and began debating what we could use it for.
Ideas:<ul>   <li>Earthen roofed cabin for the lawn mower (I ruled this out because I don't want to build a house for the lawn mower that required the use of the lawn mower)</li>   <li>Just lay the sod in the back yard, and sure it would look funny with 1/5 of the yard sod and the rest patchy grass and weeds</li>   <li>Make a VT out of the sod in the back yard.  This almost happened.</li> </ul>
We wound up with a solution that didn't require any work, was not wasteful, and made us look nice to our neighbors. We gave it to the guy that was ripping up his yard across the street. Sure it's not a homage to our Alma Mater, but we were gonna rip up the yard in the spring for seed anyway.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[My body is falling apart thanks to wushu, and work is stressing me out.  I am feeling a little burninated lately.

Wushu can be summed up in a short list:  Residual fall-on-my-head neck pain, left shoulder pain (Charlie said it was a cyst last time I saw him), a strange bump in my wrist with plenty 'o pain (cyst too a major reason I don't flip on Tuesday nights),  pulled hip abductors, stale hamstrings, shin splints and retrocalcaneal bursitis.  Oh, I also split my little toe nail in half now the two sides are pinching the toe where the nail should protect it.

But on the upside Kelly forced me to bring in some oatmeal so I can have breakfast--and she would not have to listen to me wine about being hungry and be in a place where she cannot bring me food.  I didn't really want to bring it in.  Seemed like a bit of a hassle, but when I went to  open it up and eat some this morning I realized that it is not the multi-pack, it's all peaches 'n cream!   No more picking though the maple raisin poo hoping to find some of the good stuff.

We introduced the kittens to the world of dogs this weekend.  It was a sheltered first step, as we mostly let the AJ run free and kept them locked up in the bed room.  This remained hidden under the bed.  Even with the door shut they would mostly cower in the corner. At one point Kelly wrapped Amp in her sweatshirt and brought him downstairs to see AJ first hand.  The dog didn't even notice for the longest time, while the cat's eyes were fixed and ears plastered back.  Eventually AJ caught of whiff and wanted to investigate, but Kelly in her infinite wisdom decided holding a cat while a dog investigated wasn't as much fun as it had originally seemed and returned him upstairs where he wanted to be.  After AJ left they eventually came back down stairs, upon finding no signs that the dog was still there they returned to their normal retarded behavior.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I have a groin.  Not like that, the <i>bad</i> kind.  Like our #9 midget with a groin.  The tornado kicks were so much better with the one leg set.  But that apperently stresses my hip abductor alot.  Even jump outsides were hurty.

Costume ideas, as much as I want to be the Poopsmith as M-Bison, I think I can't pull that off.  Strongsad's left leg is a good one anyway.  Yes it had to be HSR related, yes, I know very few people will get it.  It is totally worth it for those few people.  The only good non-HST idea this year has been Keith Stack from Milborne NJ, and Danny has that.  Well, a jellyfish that could actually sting people wasn't too shabby.

In other news a chinese dictionary...[phpCEDICT](/chinese/search.php).  Yay.

And we banged pots and pans at the lunar eclipse--well, at the dragon that ate the moon.  I also shook a black cat at it, 'cause them thngs are scary.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[For Posterity's Sake:

<img src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/blog/image/595/hokido.jpg" class="center" />

ho*ki do (ho'ge doe)

Hokido translates to the Way of the Tiger Energy or the Way of the Tiger Spirit. However if you pronounce it incorrectly is can easily be thought of as "The way of the Tiger Kids." All these definitions are acceptable to the founders. Unfortunately for the reputation of the art we are the founders. Let me give you the story of how this art came about.

A group of Martial artists from Virginia Tech, all of whom had either black belts in Tae Kwon Do or the equivalent in a sister art, attended the VT Tae Kwon Do club. This club took a trip down to a big tournament in Raleigh NC. It was at this very tournament that we all attended a lecture from the granddaddy of Tae Kwon Do -- General Choi. Choi went on the explain who he was and why he has sole rights to the Art of Tae Kwon Do. He explained how he founded it and if you are not doing exactly what he is doing you are doing karate. Someone even asked about Kungfu, he said that was karate. At this point he went on to explain his new Sine wave theory and using arguments that are not founded by any mathematical or scientific means (we are all engineers, BTW). Making all of his once adoring fans become confused and frustrated. We were so excited that we were going to hear the founder of the art speak, only to be seared with his condescending sermon. I am not trying to undermine this man, nor claim is art is poo, I am simply explaining the impression he had on us. I am sorry if I have offended you.

At this point we knew if we did not abide by every thing he had said, that we would not be studying "Tae Kwon Do." So we decided that we were now studying hokie-do. (Virginia Tech Hokie's) This was initially a joke. We all laughed, but after time Gerald and I continued to claim to practice Hokie-do. Starting with Our Tae Kwon Do knowledge we applied Jeet Kune Do concepts while force feeding acrobatics into it. Making Hokido a labeled version of everything we do. Much like Bruce Lee invented Jeet Kune Do (please -- don't get me wrong, I am not comparing us to him, that would be an insult to him, rather I am giving credit for the borrowed ideas), and said that take what works for you, well we did. But unlike Jeet Kune do, we are not purely concerned with fighting arts, Hokido also contains performing arts. Acrobatics and Gymnastics are just as much a part of Hokido as sparring and ground fighting.

We speak lightly of the label "Hokido," but think of it as a goal for our personal refinement.

Wow, you made it this far -- I am impressed.

Chris.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[[Wushu in the post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A26740-2004Nov4.html)

Learn Wushu

Sunday, November 7, 2004; Page M03

The movie "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" featured an epic love story, poisonous darts and graceful, gravity-defying swordplay, with lithe warriors battling each other in midair by ricocheting off walls, leaping off roofs and soaring among treetops. Although the flying was courtesy of stunt masters and cinematic special effects, there is a real martial art buried under the glitz: wushu, a modern, acrobatic variant of kung fu that is gaining in popularity locally and worldwide.

Wushu is the national sport of China -- in 2008, it'll be introduced as an event at the Beijing Olympics. While kung fu sticks to the traditional moves, wushu constantly evolves, adding more tricks, twists and turns. Advanced feats include running up a wall and flipping back down, a 720-degree spinning tornado kick and a butterfly kick that resembles a sideways-twisting layout -- all making the sport a perfect base for the gymnastics of Hong Kong action movies. (Superstar Jet Li, of "Once Upon a Time in China" and "Hero," was a member of the Beijing Wushu Team.)

Yowza. Just looking at these lunges makes our hamstrings go "ouch." (Photos Nate Lankford For The Washington Post)

Wushu has been around the D.C. area for some time but has been largely geared to the Chinese community (in Silver Spring in the mid-1990s, our high school mascot attributed his ability to do aerials and flips to his "secret Chinese sport"). As its popularity has increased, though, participants have become more diverse.

What to Expect: Your first class won't involve any fancy gymnastics or sword fighting. In fact, though wushu is a martial art, students generally aren't allowed to learn sparring until the higher levels. Instead, you'll stretch and learn the basic straight-leg kicks, such as the front and side stretching kick and the outside and inside crescent kicks. Wushu emphasizes a straight back and extended arms, so you may come away with mild soreness in those areas. Impatient athletes shouldn't fret, though: Depending on dedication and ability, it's possible to start trying acrobatics, like butterfly kicks, after about six months.

What to Bring: Shorts, a T-shirt and a clean pair of sneakers. Unlike other martial arts, wushu is not done in bare feet.

Cost: Your first two introductory classes can be had for $15 to $19. After that, weekly or semiweekly classes cost just over $100 per month, depending on the school. Anya Sostek

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Finally go back and am settled in.  We have been gone almost an entire week.  Last minute plane tickets to Texas, for Kelly's grandmother's funeral.  It was a pretty sad and tiring trip. The plus side is we did get to go see my Nana, Aunt Claudia  and G'pa Jim. The pluses also included Kelly's Uncle Bill and Aunt Diana, who's couch Kelly viciously broke.  Rendering the hide-a-bed unusable.  So we went to sleep that night on an air mattress and awoke (early) the next morning on a vinyl mat.

While it was good to see family, and I am glad Kelly got to make the rounds with hers, we need to go back and mess with Texas under better circumstances.

The flight back to DCA got in around midnight, so we got our car out of hoc and went home.  Kelly was absolutely exhausted.  The next morning we woke up, unpacked, repacked and hopped in the car and headed to Richmond.  We listened to the VT game on the radio on the way to Sara (formerly) Kretzer's wedding, and were even responsible to giving updates to the Kretzer family though out the reception.  Hooray for WAP.  When the Hokies won, Mr. K made a run for the microphone and announced it to everyone. The wedding was nice, and they had the reception right there at Grove.  Highlights of the reception included a chocolate fountain, Senior Hedrick and Brady Ojibway calling me Everett.

<img src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/blog/image/595/sara_class.jpg" class="center" />

I got dinner with Everett, while Kelly napped and we all headed to the Ojibway's house for a bonfire.  I am impressed that we didn't burn down A) the woods and B) the power lines.  I'll have to call Jason and see if his brother ever went to the hospital for jumping over the fire.  They were just warming to up the jumpin' when we left.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Thursday or Friday night I was driving home at night in the dark.  It was raining.  I was on the beltway.  The strange part was the suicidal frogs that were making a break for it across the beltway.  I could not figure out how they made it over the median.  I felt horrible for slaughtering so many apparently stupid frogs.

Maybe it is payback for the good deed of saving Capt. Snappy the Box Turtle from Lake Braddock Dr.

I later figured out that it was not frogs at all.  But leaves in the wind and rain.  I guess the wind/water ratio was perfict for imitating a frog hop.  Really freaked me out at the time.

Sorta like when I was getting really tired and thought I saw an ostridge on the side of the road.

Kelly and I finally had a weekend at home with no serious commitments.  Saturday was a polite wushu class and a pants-peeing good time at the Tullos house.  Even though most people [didn't have pants](http://www.cheapass.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&Store_Code=CAG&Product_Code=CAG530).

After church on Sunday I met up with Stephon and we finished up some shooting for the demo video we have been working on.  I started shooting video earlier this week in class, jumps, sections, etc.  So we met up when we had some extra time to finish some stuff up.  We filmed for 2 hours or so--just pure wushu, no choreo--and came back to my house to edit it.  Half way through the log 'n capture process Stephon pointed out that this takes a long time.  Heh.  Our demo vids are long from complete, but in the mean time I have posted [Stephon's Pre-demo](http://www.jianshu.net/media/StephonPredemo.mpg).

I also reposted [O-Mei Twists](http://www.fuzzymonk.com/media/omeitwists.mpg) now that I no longer have my .mac account.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Lets see, what's going on.  I am fairly sure there was something profound I wanted to make a comment about, but I am at a loss right now so I am just gonna throw in a journal update for posterity.

Demo Vids:  Coming along, no new footage.  I talked to Stephon about it and he said he didn't want to put the effort into more filming for some actual fight choreo so I going  make due with what I have.  Some of the kids at wushu don't like it, they also claim to have better ideas.  However, they can't remember what their amazing better ideas are when I am around.  I was referred to counterstrike videos.  I have not looked those up.
Stephon's latest vid is up [here](http://www.jianshu.net/media/StephonDemo.mpg).  I have yet to sequence any thing for my vid, however I have most of the footage I will use captured so it shouldn't take too long.

We have been planning for the basement remodeling.  Rip out the bar and put in a new one, and since we are doing that might as well rip out the ceiling.  Because, really who wants a ceiling.  If you are gonna do that might as well put up drywall instead of the nasty wood paneling we have. My dad even agreed to come help out with the plumbing. Now to acquire my old college mini fridge from the Nikki.

The week has been interesting: I watched VT destroyed MD and we are now11th.  I discovered that you (read: members of your team) can give your manager inappropriate departing gifts and have a great time.  I also found that you shouldn't answer the phone talking like the King of Town when your new manager calls you.  Even if you think he is Tom.  And you shouldn't keep talking like the KoT while he is trying to explain to you that you are mistaking him for another person.

<i>I have a +3 in first impressions!</i>

Oh, speaking of making fun of [D](http://www.fuzzymonk.com/media/dungeons-and-dragons-part1.mp3)&[D](http://www.fuzzymonk.com/media/dungeons-and-dragons-part2.mp3) (remember italics means I talk like a &#91;more&#93; nerdy guy &#91;than I normally talk&#93;): <i>I cast a int into a float!</i>

Well, everyone laughed so they are as dorky as I am.  Well, I am posting it to my webpage.  So I win again.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[We had a little problem getting on the beltway the other day.  We were on the on-ramp behind an inconspicuous car who drove along politely until we reached the interstate, at which point they got hammer by the fact that there was a freeway at the end of the ramp.  The dutifully hopped on the brakes, and considered what to do as dozens of cars zipped furiously by.  I am fairly sure they had no idea that the beltway would have been at the end of this ramp.

You know those people.  Chances are you were one once.  Not big deal, they always figure out that yes it is a freeway, and yes I really should go fast and keep up with everyone.

I don't I dislike this group.  The <i>Surprise! a freeway</i> folks are an unsuspecting group caught in a moment of stupidness.

They got nothing on the <i>you know what I don't understand</i> people.  Nothing.  When these people complain about the traffic they always start off with the phrase "You know what I don't understand."  Sometimes I think this may be an attempt at small talk with the other people in the car, much like talking about the weather, but it happens a little too often to be just normal small talk.

You don't understand how a road can be backed up?  With as much as they talk about it you would have thought that they would have put some thought into the subject.  Normally cars reach some sort of bottle neck.  With a road system like our in DC if the already over crowded roads encounters a circumstance that impedes performance these the reduced speed will propagate further down the road.  It does not have to be an accident.  Of it could be an accident that has been cleared.  These people do not seen to be able to come to terms with the fact that the congestion may be due to circumstances they cannot see.  In addition to this they also fail to see any possible explanation to the aforementioned congestions.  Perhaps an onramp pumping in too many cars, and maybe one of those cars contained a <i>Surprise! a freeway</i> driver, who caused the right lane to slow down to make room for them.  In turn all the <i>I's important get otta way</i> persons bailing out of the right lain slow down the middle lane...they continue to merge slowing everyone down.  There might have even been a nice safe driver who simply slowed down because it's pretty damn stupid to pass someone who is going 25 mph at 80 mph.  You don't have to approve of rubber necking to understand it.  It is a pretty annoying thing to have a 2 mile back up because people wanted to look at some twisted metal and firemen standing around. But you have to understand that people are gonna do it.

Don't get me started on browsers.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[This thanksgiving we drove.  I got off work on Wednesday before and we drove to southern Maryland.  Slept (Kelly slept, I stayed up with Neal playing GTA) at the in-rents and ate turkey, hopped in the car and drove back to Fairfax on Friday. I went and played wushu. Got a ride home and took a shower. Then drove to New Jersey, Begrudgingly.  Where we ate leftover turkey and cranberry sauce. Next day we drove around and picked out tuxes, the girls got dresses, and we drove home on Saturday. Sunday we drove not only to southern Maryland, but also back to Fairfax, for Kelly's mom's birthday's lunch thingy.

The theme of the holiday was sittin' in a car.  Luckily we had some TMBG CD's and the mix CD I made on the drive with Jason.

The current Christmas plan is to spend the eve and say in Richmond and then have a late make-up Christmas in the 'dorf a few days after that.  So that should be a bit more relaxing.  With the exception of Christmas Eve at grandma's with all the cousins.  That is not relaxing.  Fun though.

I may skip skiing this season.  Not like I was really doing much the past couple of seasons, but I 1) don't want to spend the money on equipment (and using my current boots means hurty) and 2) don't want to run the chance of hurting my self - this is my last team trials and if I miss 6 weeks cause of a broken leg I am not gonna help my chances.

Newest annoyance: the crooked support our troops ribbon magnets on cars every where.   It is a ribbon, not a fish.  A ribbon is worn with the curvy part at the top and the pointy ends of the ribbon are down.  It is not at an angle so people can read the words.  Those words are there at a reference incase someone just migrated to the US and didn't know what the yellow ribbon stands for.  You do not have to make them level for people to read them.  Please, drivers of mini vans everywhere, allow your ribbons to stand up proud.  None of our troops want lying down or <i>leanie</i> support.  They want strong upright purposeful support.

I may go to the mall this shopping season with the quest to right all the ribbons there.  Assuming I can find a parking spot.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[What I did at work today.

<img src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/blog/image/595/Chair_Chris02.jpg" />

squeezing though the arm of a chair!

<img src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/blog/image/595/Chair_Chris03.jpg" />

Hurts real bad. And I have a big butt.

<img src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/blog/image/595/Chair_Tom02.jpg" />

Tom could do it too.

<img src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/blog/image/595/Chair_ChrisTom.jpg" />

Then we raced.  I lost.  Tom won easy because he thought ahead and took off his belt.

<img src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/blog/image/595/Chair_Tom08.jpg" />

Tom up's the ante and goes for the 2fer.

<img src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/blog/image/595/Chair_Tom09.jpg" />

He said it was scary.  I said it was funny.  Ben did work.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Two days later, we are back at it:
<img src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/blog/image/595/Ben_Chair08.jpg" />
This time Ben joined in the fun

<img src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/blog/image/595/Ben_Chair02.jpg" />
Only with his freakish little waist he holds the record for fastest time

<img src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/blog/image/595/Chris_Chair09.jpg" />
I went for the 2-in-a-row

<img src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/blog/image/595/Tom_Chair15.jpg" />
Tom went back for a better run

<img src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/blog/image/595/Tom_Chair16.jpg" />
New challenge is backwords and upside down

<img src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/blog/image/595/Tom_Chair12.jpg" />
Rules: Can't touch anything other than the chair and the floor

<img src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/blog/image/595/Ben_Chair04.jpg" />
Starts off awkward

<img src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/blog/image/595/Ben_Chair11.jpg" />
Then it get way more awkward

<img src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/blog/image/595/Chris_Chair05.jpg" />
There's a reason we take off our belts

<img src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/blog/image/595/Tom_Chair17.jpg" />
What office game could be more professional?]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[A few days later we were back at it.

<img src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/blog/image/595/Ben_Chair08.jpg" />

This time Ben played too

<img src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/blog/image/595/Ben_Chair02.jpg" />

He holds the record for fastest time

<img src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/blog/image/595/Chris_Chair09.jpg" />

I went for the 2-in-one

<img src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/blog/image/595/Tom_Chair15.jpg" />

And Tom looked to better his last attempt

<img src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/blog/image/595/Ben_Chair04.jpg" />

New game: Upsided down and backwards

<img src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/blog/image/595/Tom_Chair16.jpg" />

Don't feel bad for Tom, it was his idea

<img src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/blog/image/595/Ben_Chair11.jpg" />

Rule #1: you can only touch the chair and the floor

<img src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/blog/image/595/Chris_Chair05.jpg" />

Are those man clogs in the background?

<img src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/blog/image/595/Tom_Chair17.jpg" />

Pure glee]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<b>New Rule</b>

We have had to add a new house rule for the cats.

The old ones were as follows:
1) Don't go outside.
2) Don't go in the utility room.
3) Don't go under the couch.

The new one is:
4) Don't eat light bulbs.

We were sitting on the couch enjoying a lazy Sunday evening, watching tivo'd Stargate and we heard a muffled <i>pow</i> sound come from behind the tree.  It was almost like the broke one of the ornaments, but we at least had the foresight to only put plastic, fabric and other non-breakable ornaments down low where they could reach them.  Well, didn't think about the lights. Figured they might play with them a little, not destroy them. After we discovered the broken bulb between the cats we watched them carefully until we caught Ampere going to town on one of the lights.  He was hauling off to bite down with some of his back teeth.  I of course screamed and threw stuff and ran over and grabbed him and proceeded to instruct him in some detail on why he should not eat light bulbs.

<b>ACC</b>

VT 16, Miami 10.  ACC Champs baby.  We watched the game at Grevey's (Alumni game watching HQ) with Dmitry, Josh, Jeannie and friends.  It rocked.

On a side note, Grevey's is much less smoky than Kilroy's, which is where we originally thought Dmitry was gonna get a table.

<b>Sky box</b>

On the topic of good food.  Luxury Sky box rocks for one reason alone: Free hotdogs.  I guess the free beer, private bathrooms and a climate controlled view of the game were also pretty good.  It was especially fun when we got the tickets ripped on the way in and the guy said <i>Suite, sweet!</i>  Didn't quite feel like football, but the redskins won and I ate a lot of hotdogs so it was a good time.

<b>Game night X2</b>

We doubled up on the game nights this weekend.  Starting off with Chris and Danny's and the chasing it the following night at our place.  Highlights included playing "[Eat Poop You Cat](http://skytek.yi.org/eatpoopyoucat/)" at Danny's and Watching Tom loose to Karen in [shock tanks](http://www.shockingfun.com/product/SHOCKTANK).]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[A combination of stupidity, curiosity, and craziness.
(This is the best description of my cats to date)

Well the birthday week is has now come and gone. And for me, I am happy about it, cause this birthday stuff is getting kinda old. Perhaps if you still got as many birthday presents as you did when you were a kid it would be a little better. Or may if it didn’t mean you were old(er)

We had a wushu-people party on Friday and a Family/Friends one on Saturday. The Friday wushu party left something to be desired. We traditionally have one for me and Glenn together (8th represent), and we added in Paula and Amina recently. Well Amina is MIA in China, so it was just Paula. Apparently the majority of the people that were invited didn't even know that Glenn and I were even involved until we sang the happy birthday song with the candle lit cake. I was a little annoyed. This group of people also took to cliquing off and gossiping about wushu stuff that we were blatantly overlooked for. More annoyed. Then there was the kindergartner that prevented caps (I consider it impolite and louche to play drinking games when I have been stuck watching a young child). We did get to play some Risk and throw down a bit of Wei Qi, but people were just unable to intermingle successfully. The worst part was that the USWA guys basically came and went. I really wanted to chill with Philip and Glenn more, but it just didn't work. It was cool eating Vyvy's fried chicken and playing Wei Qi with Stephon, Chad and [G](http://www.tatu-bola.net/).

The next night we had the Tulli clan and the McHugh sect over plus Gerald. This was much funner. G and the Tulli were there for some tasty Kelly dinner and then the McFriends came over for cake and brought some super fun presents. Jeannie and Dirk even showed up Kelly (according to Kelly) with their dart board. It harkens back to a time when I got schooled by Jeannie on Kelly birthday. How can I beat a Ritz gift certificate?

Work as been all server all the time. <i>I'll get you Eh, Makefile!</i>

Wushu is optional spear -- and nandu training. Shins throb constantly, hamstrings are stale twizzlers, and abductors are indignant.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[It's cold in the nation's capital today.

The coldness actually started last night.  It got windy as it got dark. Kelly and I shut our selves in the house after a bit of decemberween shopping.  Kelly set right to baking.  I watched TV for a while and then felt guilty for not doing anything and decided to wrap some presents.  We baked and wraped, wrapped and baked.  Even did some laundry in there.  Since I had eaten little more than a couple of Baja fresh tacos that day, and the evening was quickly slipping away, I went in and started to make my self some bagel bytes--which is a default when Kelly is unable to cook for me.  So I dumped the rest of the pizzas on a bagel into the toaster oven and set it to 400 degrees.

Rrrrrrrooooooouuuuuuuunnnnnnnnnn.

Black.  Power was out.  Wait, no, back on.  Nope, off again.  On!  No, off.  Power was out.  And there was a batch of cookies in the oven and my Pizzas on a bagel in the toaster.  And Tivo was recording the final episode of Earthsea (a dramatic conclusion, fosho).  Our plan was to let the cookies finish on the oven then quickly swap them for the mini-bagel-pizzas and hope they get to finish, or at the very least finish thawing, in the big oven.  Kelly was fine with the cookies getting cut off (we had a plan), and the fact that my dinner was in jeopardy didn't seem to be disturbing to her.  She was a bit frazzled when she realized that Tivo was, lets say, asleep.

"But tivo goes though the phone line, so it can still get it right...it's on the server...it's all gonna be ok, right?"

She did calm down eventually.

Then we did what any young married couple should do on a cold winter night when the power goes out-we made cookie boxes for our co-workers!  (Which were a huge hit here)

Around 1 a.m.  the power was restored, and seemingly everything we owned that was plugged in decided it would partake in the energy consumption and turn on to show its worried owners that everything was alright. So I ran around turning off lights, TV's, computers, you name it. Back in bed, under the warm covers with the heat pumping again. 15 min later Tivo figured its thing out and turned on so the stereo started playing.  I enjoyed cursing as I ran barefoot on the hard, cold floor.

This morning, in a moment of pure inspiration, Stephon came over and we rand around the lake.  We had to be careful be especially the patches of ice on the running path.  2 pairs of sweatpants and 3 sweatshirts really wasn't enough.  That was a bad idea.

Least It was half price burger days at Whitlow's.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Let me jot a few things down real quick like.

Christmas was fun; some parts more fun than others.  Christmas had 3 parts. For first charismas we went to Grandma's.  This was a pretty good one, it was just a little awkward.  Kelly doesn't feel completely comfortable around that group, and I can't say I blame her.  I don't see my uncles and their families very often, so there is a certain amount of forced polite interaction.  Highlights: My hammer present from Amiee wrapped as a hammer and thinking Kelly didn't get presents.

Christmas 2 was pretty good, my rent's place with the nephews.  More comfortable all around.  Lots of presents, excitement and furniture. We had fun comparing Kelly's new camera to my mom's.  And watching the H*R DVD I gave to Nikki.  I totally rocked the Craftsman tools this year.  Slightly used circular saw, baby.

Christmas 第三(di san) will be tomorrow night, at the Tullos chateau in Waldorf, Maryland.

Last night we hung with Sean and Nina, enjoyed some Xi Shang Fan (Beijing Kaoya!) and Game night with their high school friends. I schooled everyone in falling and even taught Nina how to do a roundhouse kick on S's heavy bag.  Nina taught Kelly how to knit.

I feel, um, less than.  Under the weather, say.  I was properly sick with a real cold last week.  Started out with some sore throat and I chased it with proper congestion.  This week I am just a little stuffy.  Of course it took half the day for my ear to unclog, and I have a residual "swimmy" feeling, but I am better than last week.  I do feel like I am that kid* I knew in middle school that always had a bloody nose. I blame the dry weather.

I want to go train.  I needa figure out my spear form, and sit down and add up the nandu values for my changquan form.  I really hope team trials aren't in May.  If it is May 28 I don't know what I am going to do, so please--oh please, Lord--do allow team trials on May 28th.  Any other day of the year.  <b>ANY.</b>

*Yeah, that was me.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[New years there was no trip to the outer banks, no Brandon or Gerald. I guess it was pretty sad we didn't go, but we were feeling crappy, and forcing our selves to drive 6 hours down there would have been no fun at all.  We instead opted for a nice, quite, sober night at home.

We played darts (killer and no-score cricket), watched the ball drop, then invented games with Sean's newly acquired huge playground-type ball.  My favorite game was the one where you heels had to touch the wall then you could jump, roll your body on the ball and see how far you could go.  Our goal was to touch the other wall, but we never made it.  About a foot shy.

New Year 's Day we had a wushu demo.  Lots of last minute changes on our part and theirs.  We were supposed to go second, but they changed it on us right before the show and we had to go last.  Bah.  The demo went really well, all the sets were very together and everything flowed well.  I think the last min removal of basics really helped keep the rhythm.  Kelly and I bolted once it was finished.

Yesterday I went to wushu early yesterday to work on some spear choreography.  The idea was that I would have plenty of time to then get my hair cut and get home before the game.  Everything went according to plan for half an hour or so, then coach made Chad, Stephon and I take the 5 o'clock class.  Eventually I decided that I really did want to get a hair cut, and I knew that Dianne got off at 6, so did a couple of sections and told coach I had to bail.  She pointed out that if she didn't force me into the 5 o'clock class that I would done something then left.  I informed her that was my plan.  I liked my plan.

However after 2 weeks of traveling and being sick I was fairly happy to start with the 5 o'clock class.  I'm not sore, but I can tell that I did something.

And I got 3 shaky sections of spear to show for it.    1 features a b-t and tornado, 2 has an aerial, and 3 is the body turn spinney jump thing Stephon showed me. 4 will prolly be butterfly based.

We lost our game.  We lost it good and proper in the first half.  There was a fair amount of redemption in the 4th quarter, but not enough time.  Hokies rocked this year, no matter what.  6th in the ACC, HA!

Cats don't like it when you scream at football.  Amp likes to eat plastic bags and light bulbs.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Fragments on a chain.

Slept through last weekend--pretty much the entire thing, including moving Neal and wushu.

Sunday was Sean's birthday. We got him a monster disk Frisbee thing.  Kelly made come cake.

Watched Napoleon Dynamite.  Promptly changed my away message to: "Yeah right. Who's the only one here who knows the illegal ninja moves from the government?"

Lifted Monday morning, strained my left hamstring doing stiff-legged dead lifts.  And I was going light.  Wushu that night was, um, slower than normal.  Was still able to hit ATs and BTs, but 540s (outside and inside) were hurting.  That in combination with the strained abductor from Friday's tornados made for slowness.

I'm feeling slow again today, which makes me dread training tonight.  I am supposed to train sword and chase it with gymnastics.  I am may have to bail on the gym, but we will see after a bunch of sword twirling.

Talked for quite a while with Everett.  He's engaged, thinks he <i>might</i> be the last of the class to get hitched.  Much ranting of suburban life, people growing up and the like.  Nostalgic.  I couldn't tell if I was remembering high school or Napoleon Dynamite.

Put my china pictures up and have been working on the [wushuwiki](http://www.wushuwiki.org) in my spare time.  I should be cleaning the guest room, sewing, and using hydrochloric acid to burn H*R designs into solid glass.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[After pulling my hamstring on Monday this week was a bit of a bust.  I trained Monday night, which didn't help too much.  So I missed Tuesday sword and gymnastics.  Wednesday I was supposed to teach, but coach was inspired*, so she taught.  This meant I trained—for two classes. I did very little on the left side, of course this meant stepping up a little bit with the right to prove to coach I wasn’t slacking.  Now it is Friday and my left leg is back in action and my right is sore.

Didn’t lift legs like I wanted to this morning, did some light leg curls for a little conditioning.  Tom's right, I should prolly cut out lifting and go skiing.  I have never be injured skiing. Good leg workout too.

Then again, I think I have been properly sore after a day or two of skiing.

Skipping wushu last  night was better because at least we had a work-fun-event-thingy, and all got to go to the melting pot for some fondue fun.  Highlight of the night was making Meredith laugh when she was seeing how much water she should suck out of her glass at once.  Water came out her nose.  Then Tom and Mer decided to try at the same time with two straws in one glass.  Meredith laughed again, this time with the added bonus of spitting all over Tom.  Fondue is fun, but it is beyond me why everyone didn't do the restaurant week deal.

I went home and watched that show.  Ross would be proud.  But I may stay home be a pure nerd tonight.  NERD!

*By a chinese guy telling her the <b>exact</b> same thing we have been telling her, only she considers him to be business smart.  He is our age, grew up in the US, trains at a typical MA school--so he has no credentials on us.  I am gonna blame the language barrier, but remain bitter for a bit.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[By the time I got home from the one o'clock class I was dead.  Coach had worked us hard on Friday with really technical stuff.  The technical stuff that I need to be working on flavor, speed, explosiveness...qipo.  But the hamstrings hated me for it.  I only pissed them off more on Saturday.  After I went up and talked to a walk-in about the school for 15 min in the middle of the class I returned to find that the musles in my thigh were in full self defense mode.  Tried a 3 kick drill.  I just walked off the floor annoyed.  After class we had to practice for a demo, one that no one knew about.  But we were suspicious when the Chinese girls showed up.  Coach yelled at me about the straight sword set, said I was doing little things wrong, like left hand position, said it looked like I forgot it.  Of course she didn't seem to remember that I wasn't in this set last time, and as  result they changed it to accommodate the different participants.  Like hell I am gonna do that new old-old fight set in the middle! Daayum!

I get home and I am a total ass to Kelly.  Just exhausted and hurting.  She has been baking like crazy, sure Sean was there to help (play video games), but she was up to her elbows in some sort of raspberry moose.  Honestly the cake was of the most complicated things I have ever seen.   Spring form pans, moose, whipping cream, removal of raspberry seeds, shaved chocolate, every spatula and bowl we own-twice, no to mention the cake is self.  But we are in a hurry to get this thing ready to take along to Danny's so it will be ready for Jeannie's birthday. She winds up vetoing taking it along, and we just call the fellas and tell them they will have to return to our place if they want to eat this beast.  We show up at the restaurant an hour late, not entirely our fault, to find 'em standing at the bar. Alone.

Eat a bean and beef burrito, with juice.  Return home.

Eventually the cake and presents and playing with the cats winds up and we have a new plan to go out.  Because of the aforementioned hell wushu class I bitch to Kelly about this the entire drive out to Ballston. She says I should go sleep at Danny's. I ever so impolitely refuse.  We board the metro for DuPont.  That is one really long escalator. Everyone was talking up it.  Just like last time when we went there and I was exhausted with a side of leg pain, I attempted to walk up it.

We did pass a large gathering of bike messengers meeting in the circle.  Headed to the bar and found an empty shuffle board table.  I was driving, so I figured I could drink one or two and stop, or not drink at all.  Though hard about it and decided I needed something else.  Precious caffeine.  I went to Starbucks and got some coffee.  30 minutes later I was playing shuffle board and not noticing my legs.  My hamstrings were still hurty, but I didn't notice my lower legs at all.

Starbucks was closing as I made my purchase, and it's tricky to get into the bar with a beverage, so while I was drinking my coffee I sat on one of the benches in the circle. This turned out to be more exciting than normal.  Because normally it would be pretty fun.  But tonight we had the bike messengers there.  Fixed gears, no breaks, Timbuk2 and Ortlieb bags everywhere.  They were getting ready for their fun messenger race, handing out manifests. They all knew each other, it was a very intriguing social group.  I am gonna be a bike messenger when I grow up simply for the sub-culture.  They remind me of a less hostile skater scene, or martial artists with out the politics.  So many different kinds of people--diversity with a common unique style.  Plus their own special definition of hardcore.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[The snow and driving in it.

The snow started coming up right after I showed up to work.  I guess the tall buildings around the office refused to let it come down, so out our window it tended to go up.  It would go up to the left, and to the right, but mostly up.  If you went outside you would expect there to be no snow on the ground, as it all had fallen up.  But it was there none-the-less.  The closed the building before noon, so I took off around 11:30. Went down, scraped my window, paid the full $10 for parking as was off.

I followed my usual route down to Rt. 50, but abandoned that thinking the interstate would be a better idea.  It was backed up on 66, and down Fairfax so I made a dash for Carlin Springs Rd.  It was wide open, very little traffic, everyone driving a nice safe steady pace.  That all ended abruptly as we crested the last hill before we would pass under Rt. 50. Stopped dead.  People on the Ballston bound side were sliding all over the place.  There were a couple of people out helping, so I pulled the jeep off to the side, turned the wheels into the curb, threw on the hazards and went to see what was going on.  The snow had just become packed down and icy, it was slick.  But we were able to successfully push a few cars up the hill.  I was most impressed with the Subaru that guy in scrubs had, he used it to push a van up the hill.  Said the bumpers matched up, and went to town.  I wished he would of hung around to push more vans up the hill, because those things can be a pain.  Eventually our helper dwindled and we discovered our core group.  A park ranger, all 5'3" of her; a girl about my age who works for the state department; a Coca-Cola van driver whose van wasn't going anywhere and me.  Eventually state department girl called her roommate and she cam out to help too.

We had cars going on the Ballston bound side, but the people headed to Colombia Pike were out of luck, shortly after we got the TransAm--that had a dead battery in the middle of the hill--off the road we had a school bus and one of those pull-up-to-a-construction-site-and-sell-cheese-steaks trucks blocking the road.  The food truck was spinning its wheels and the rear end swung around until they were properly blocking the entire road at the top of the icy hill.  Everyone else refused to wait, and the all filled in until all the road space on this slick hill was full of cars.  This would prove to be a big problem when the sand trucks would finally show up, but that wasn't going to happen for a while.

Eventually on the Ballston bound side, we had pushed most of the cars that were on the hill up and the park ranger was able to keep the rest waiting at the bottom.  Aside from a few jerks that drove around the congestion and would decided to make a run at the hill before we were able to get it cleared.  Inevitably they would have to stop, because of some one blocking the road and (yay!) now we would have two stuck people on the road.  And one of them would not acknowledge us because they were the type that would drive around dozens of cars on the shoulder, ignore the nice person standing out in the snow directing traffic and go anyways.  We would push them; they would spin tires till the wonderful smell of burnt rubber and a cloud of exhaust surrounded the car.  People in the nice cars fit their stereo-type perfectly.  Of course there were a few exceptions, very gracious people in BMWs would come along, that was clearly not normal.  Normally a BMW/Benz/Audi would show up and pull around one or two people waiting their turn and insist on going.  We would try to explain the strategy, tell them to wait, but it wasn't always the easiest thing to communicate to them.

I am not saying all the jerks drove nice cars, and I realize that it is just a stereotype, but this adventure gave me and idea as to where it came from. We can also deal with the stereotype of the people who didn't speak English, but I think the real problem was they simply didn't understand the directions.  We did try a combination of mime and sign language, but normally they didn't get it, and would freak out and get stuck.

We had one guy in a big F-250 (whom gave us a bag of salt, thank you sir) had me get in and show him how to put his truck on four wheel drive, I then explained to him in words I am sure he did not comprehend, how to lock his hubs.

Two cars with dead batteries. That TransAm was winner on that one.

One pickup with 6 bags of kitty litter, we were able to swipe two bags, plus the bag he dumped out in front of his truck.  Kitty litter + slush + fast spinning card tires = a thick nasty plaster on the front of your pants. The salt from F-250 guy makes sure it stings when it gets on your face.

The main entertainment was having people roll down their windows to talk to us.  There were the helpful people, the worried people, the ones that were just curious what was going on, and the irate indigent people.

First some background.  At first I parked my jeep on the side of the road at the top of the hill.  I later decided that it would be a better idea to park it down the hill in front of the ranger's pickup, which had its rollers rolling. The state department girl asked me if I could move her jeep down there too, since (according to her) I knew jeeps and how to drive in the snow. So we were being blocked by the ranger, against the median just before the break where the Ballston bound side could turn to make a left.  Not that they wanted to because that road was backed up too.

 Ok.  So, there was one lady demanded to know who owned the jeeps that were parked on the median, when we said they were ours, she then proceeded to demand that we move them.  Said we should at least push them up the hill.  I am not exactly sure why, since the hill was backed up to the bus and truck, but was rather worked up.  When we suggested that she come help she rolled up her window and stared straight forward. Which seemed to be the tactic from most of the impolite people, roll down your window, say something hurtful, roll it up and *poof* the world outside your car goes away.

The lady that wanted to know how much longer, I said I didn't' know.  She apparently didn't like that answer so she rephrased her question and asked again. By the third rewording, something like "are we going to get out of her today", I said "maybe" and she snapped her head forward and rolled up her window.  On the way up I offered to find her something helpful to do to speed up the progress. Must not of been able to hear me because she just continued to look forward.

Of course when the nice ladies offered to come out and help--if they were not dressed warmly or had worthless dress shoes--we would insist they stay in the car.  When another lady pulled up in a nice Acura said (rather condescendingly) that she has on high heals and couldn't help I fired back "Well take off your shoes and come push!" of course I only said that in my head.  But it was the best internal monologue comeback of the day.

Eventually the sand trucks came, the first one got though with out too much effort, when the cars still had enough space to pull off.  The sand helped but people were still getting stuck, and we will still had to push. More people came and filled in our sand truck only lane.  Eventually a second truck showed and was trying to get the other side moving, but was unable to get around the people who filled in our tuck lane, since everyone had packed over to the right for the last one.  He had to back up.  A Miata pulled in behind him.  I threw my hands up to get her to stop.  She just kept going.  I had to stand in front of her to get her to stop, but at that point she was right up on the truck.  I told her she had to back up.  She said she lives down there.  I told her I lived way over there and that she still had to backup to let the truck out.  Her tire spun.  Claimed she can't move.  After those pickups and vans her miniature car was easy to push. She didn't like pulling off into a gap until it was demonstrated that she needed to do this for her own good.  Once she realized that if she helped it would prevent her car from getting damaged and allow her to get home sooner she was much nicer.  What I can't understand is that we had to go though so much effort to get that point across.

We got her car out of the way, and I asked two people to get out of their cars (I found warmly dressed ones) and prevent any more cars form coming down and blocking the truck.  They said ok.  5 minutes later here comes another car and neither person ever bothered to get out.  Luckily we had a short feisty black lady from the other side come direct traffic.  The people coming off 50 couldn't tell what was going on and would try to drive around, but we needed to get that truck out so we could finally free the food truck.  Feisty black lady to the rescue. The rest of us could go back to pushing that last car.

Sand truck made it around, backed down and freed up the food truck and school bus.  Once that started going, the people could make it up the hill and a sand trucks started coming from the other direction.  It took them forever to get out there but once they did there were plenty of sand trucks and after a few passes everything flowed nicely.

Ranger lady, state department girl and roommate, coke truck guy and I stood around and bitched about the assholes we had to deal with.  Said it was time to go find another icy hill in need.  We said a collective atta-boy. Jumped in our cars and all headed home.

Way more fun than sitting in traffic waiting.]]></content:encoded>

 Cory from wushu is the coolest guy ever.  Best burrito is a free burrito.  Especially if it has black beans, carnitas, green tomatillo and sour cream. Cory, if you ever stop by my work I will give you free lines of code.  Or a postit.  Oh, the OC night would be better if we didn't have to watch the apprentice.  Or the OC for that matter--which was absolutely with-out-a-doubt ridiculous.  It’s bounding over predatory sea life.

  

 We are going to Baltimore.  It is supposed to snow.  We may be in Baltimore for some time.  I just posed to t notice that omei will be closed.  <homer>I have a feeling some bad stuff is about to go down.</homer>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Finally wet back to gymnastics.  It had been weeks, nay, months since we had gone.  This time Jeff (CMAI, QDX and other acronyms) joined us.  At first we were a little scared because when we showed up there was a sign on the door saying they were closed.  But the sign said they were closed because the plumbing was out of order, and when we opened the door to check things out Carlos said they could still have adult class, but no peeing.  At least inside.

This was fun mostly because we had the entire gym to our selves.  We wound up goofing off most of the night.  Chad worked on some aerial, Jeff jumped into the pit and the rest of us just played. Stephon came up with the brilliant idea that we should learn some high bar, so we did just that.  Got Carlos to come help us (by help I mean catch us when we fell) and practiced doing some backwards hip circles and some sort of backwards hip circle mount thing.  We also learned some key principals about the high bar and the male anatomy.  Put the bar on your waist or thighs, never in between.  Made for some hysterical laughter when done incorrectly, especially when it was someone else screwing it up.

The biggest draw back to gymnastics was kicking the bolt used for tying down the uneven bars over the pit.  I was rearranging an 8" mat on the far side of the pit and just kicked the bolt.  Cracked my big toenail and had a nice ooze of blood coming from under it.  Made it a little hurty to do walk around.

Last night we had a demo for the New World Bilingual Institute and the West Potomac High School Chinese Club.  They were expecting a couple of hundred.  The only people that showed were their members.  So we did a little demo in the school cafeteria and got our names written in Chinese by the scary lady that runs the NWBI.  But I did get invited to the Go club meeting.  I believe that give me sente.

Not sure it was a better use of my time than training spear.  But my hip abductor and lower legs needed a rest.  I plan on resting them again tonight by skipping wushu and just going to game night at CENTRA East. It's true, <i>I eat alphabet soup while days pass.</i>

Now I must insist that you go [here](http://www.stanford.edu/~scodary/TKAM.swf).  Ninjas, Pirates, Sharks on fire!]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Kelly got two nicely framed Monet posters and I got a iPod shuffle. Why? Early valentines mostly. It was also hard to hide two big ole, huge old, pictures with out Kelly finding them.

<img src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/blog/image/595/ipodshuffle.gif" align="left" />Now I must wait a full month for the iPod fun can begin.  So sad.  So long. Not fair, kelly can listen to her framed posters all she wants.

Tuesday was an interesting day.  Started off with chaos. Let's recap:

 * Phone ringing for a cab we didn't order, twice

 * Loud getting ready by my wife

 * Turning on of bedside lamp by my wife

 * Phone ringing due to frantic wife and sheets of ice

 * Crying wife

 * Cats attempted suicide while I was lifting

 * Cats breaking a bowl while I showered

 * Discovered shards of glass on my freshly showered bare feet

 * Work (wont compile and this time the errors are <i>more</i> cryptic!)

 * No training, must go eat dinner with kelly's coworkers

 * Show up at a fancy pants hotel, go to room, wife leaves

 * Sit in the hotel lobby

 * Get informed that VP's are getting kicked out of the party so chances of me getting in are slim

 * Sit in the upstairs lobby, play scrabble

 * Get free steak dinner(!)

 * Spend the night in the hotel room wondering what the cats are breaking

But steak and a hearty <i>atta boy</i> from work for kelly make for a good day.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Microcenter rocks.  Or inadvertently allowed Kelly to hook me up so I could rock out. Only place in town that had a Shuffle in stock, and it was going to be full month before it would even ship from the apple store.

I wound up skipping Saturday class, multiple reasons.  The main reason was the nasty pulling pain on the inside of my knee.  When I would initially stretch I'd get a jolt that would run diagonally across my hamstring around the knee to the base of the knee cap.  I don't know how I managed to hurt it, I first noticed it in class on Friday, so it could be a direct wushu injury, or I may of aggravated it when I was lifting that morning.  I did do some strange adductor pulldowns.  Also Ben was supposed to come over and we would rip apart his car to salvage his stereo equipment. After multiple calls saying he was gonna be later he showed.  We full disassembled his car and decided that it might be better to put everything back in.  We were half way though with that when Kelly got back and decreed (in a nice way) that we were going to Red Robin. We dropped everything, I moved the car (and its disassembled shifting assembly) into a guest spot, and we left.  Even now it sits there with its interior disassembled.

We had a long, long demo on Saturday at Mason.  For the NWBI, which is the same group that Sean and I tried to find last year for the go club -- I finally met the instructor of that course and talked to him for a few minutes.  Turns out he is a 4th Dan and a CS professor.  Sounds like stereotypical go player to me.  Plus they had a Chinese go set with the crazy one-flat-side pieces.

Apparently that dancing kid's song has more meaning to it than I would [prefer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragostea_din_tei)

Oh, and I retaught my self long division today.  It confused me, mostly because I could do long division in binary but not in decimal. now I can.  and guess what I figured out... 288/6=48.  yay.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Just a quick wushu post.

Spear.  I was on track to having another mother-of-all-frustration classes.  Then coach made me to section one of compulsory, only to point out that it has much better flow than my optional.  Then told me I should change compulsory a little and just do that.  I know what you are thinking "Oh no she didn't!", but yes, she did.  After that I insisted on doing my optional and was fairly obviously frustrated, annoyed, frizzled and otherwise pissed off.  Things were not going well in the spear class.

I guess the extreme flustered white guy prodded her into action.  And in 5 minutes she had gutted and remade my entire section one--with all the combos I really wanted--into a new, smooth section.  Much better.  Now why did it take so much for that to happen.  Changquan and jian are one thing, we have been doing those longer and practice them more often.  Spear was much more tricky.  Never competed in it before, at TT '03 I was a gun/jian guy (freak!).  Staff was my first weapon.  Seriously.  Take a powder.

In the end my section was much better, but why, oh why was all that necessary?

Tonight in class I really should train full sets.  My main deterrent is my lower legs, nothing feels right.  My ankles have been feeling odd.  Not really weak, but not strong.  Plus I still have that knee pain on the front inside of my right knee.  Again, not a constant pain, but every once in a while I get a jolt from it.

Lets not talk about my right shin.  If I train hard it hurts.  My entire wushu career has been accented by shinsplints.  If I slack off a few weeks the pain will vanish.  And I distinctly remember prepping for TT'03 with hours and hours of serious training and having the  shin pain go away.  Not sure why I was able to train it away then, or if I am going to get to the point where it will stop hurting again, but I really wish it would. Perhaps I should give that podiatrist a call again.

Fun fact: Microcenter is out of shuffles, but the Apple store in Tysons has them back in stock.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Valentines day.

I set out with the plan to pull off the best Valentines Day ever.  Not super expensive or luxurious, but a honest wholesome romantic evening.  And by that I mean that I would simply cater the evening to Kelly, making sure that everything is just right for her.  Make a dinner that was somewhat complicated, good 'n tasty, and good for you.  Sneak in a late present--which I wasn't allowed to buy--but it would be practical enough for her to overlook that.  But fun enough that she was actually excited about it.

It all started out with a trip to the grocery store.  Well, a trip home to get the ingredient list that I had written down on a post-it then to the grocery store.  I really don't like the grocery store, and this time I had an intricate list of foodstuffs that I had to track down.  Including cilantro, which despite my finding the sign for, did not exist until I finally caught someone in the produce section and had them go fetch me some more.  Yep, no idea where Thai Fish Sauce was, or if I could even find fresh red chilies.  I'd say it took about an even hour to track down everything I wanted.  Not all grocery store, I ran to target to get the secret present--a maroon carpet, which would match our new drapes in the bedroom AND not attract cat hair like the light side of duct tape. They didn't have it anymore.  They had the runner and the throw rug versions, yes, but not the full rug. So I paced up and won the isle until I settled on a backup.

Back to the house to prepare the food. But first I must sneak the rug in with out being caught.  Reverse burglaring, if you will. I took it out of the jeep.  Stared suspiciously down the street and made a mad dash for the front door.  I fumbled for my keys while glancing over my shoulder for the green Jetta. Um, yeah, she didn't show up for like an hour.

Before I could cook I had to clean. Lots of lasagna dishes and pans and more pans. Then I unloaded all the groceries, and got to work.

Ok, I needed to combine garlic and cilantro into a paste.  Needed a mortar and pestle, I knew Kelly got one for Christmas but had no idea where it was.  Called and asked, she told me exactly where it was, which I took for some where else.  I looked everywhere for it except for where she told me (I even looked in the bedroom), and eventually figured out on my own what she told me to start with.  Stupid over the stove.

At this point things were going much more smoothly.  I could find shallow pans to marinade the steak, and was able to grind things into a paste, chop up fresh herbs, the whole bit.  I got the steak marinating and went to work on the dressing.  Not having fresh chilies I used canned green chilies, which as far as I can tell are much more, um, watery. Grinding them into a paste with garlic was tricky.  The chilies ground up easy, but lubricated the garlic enough that I couldn't trap it to grind it.  So I spent a while squishing individual pieces of minced garlic up.  One at a time, and even then they would get away from me and I would be stuck chasing this little bit of garlic around the bowl insisting that I would turn it onto a tasty paste.

The next and final cooking snag was over cooking the meat.  Not much, I was shooting for medium or a bit rarer.  The freekin' Williams Sonoma brand thermometer screwed me.  It is remote gizmo that does all the fancy stuff like say "Beef==medium well" or "30 seconds left", where the transmitter simply reports the temperature. Well, they weren't communicating.  So I tinkered with them until they did, and that involved turning them off and back on.  By that time some time had passed and I didn't know how long and suddenly the beef was registering at 174.  Well done is 170, I wanted 160 at best.  Well, Neal woulda liked it.

I arranged the Thai Beef Salad in a big bowl, which we shared.  Plopped it on the table.  Decreed that we needed to have shots with dinner, and sent Kelly to get the drinks.  She brought Caffeine free coke and no shot glasses.  I gave her a rug.  Watched Battlestar and she packed for Richmond.  The thanks I get.  Frack.

In other news Tom's bid lost.  A town house in burke, asking $375 or so, went for way over $400.  Double Damn.  The market needs to cool it so Tom can move to Burke and <i>then</i> it can resume this insanity.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Mysterious calf injury.

Ok, so this is really turning into my injury log.

I started feeling it on Thursday after spear class.  I was fine all through class but afterwards I was walking through section and notices my lower calf was hurting a little.  I continued for s second, stopped and hobbled off.

It started in the Soleus muscle, but later seem to radiate out to the Gastrocnemius.  It didn't seem to fit with any of the calf conditions that I was able to look up. The sudden (yet gradual) onset, no acute injury, the odd pain; I was like "what the hell," and pouted in my frustration.  It didn't hurt like normal muscle strain, more like how my muscle would feel after a bad cramp. It definitely got worse before it got better.  Thursday night was noticeable, but Friday and Saturday were painful. By Sunday I was better, and even today I still have a fair amount of discomfort.  And I still have no clue.

This made the Fair Oaks Mall demos slightly unpleasant.  The Saturday show I arrived with the intention of helping out, and not performing.  I wound up doing dragon.  For the first time ever, never performed it before, never even practiced it.  I had helped coach it some, but it's easy to point out mistakes.

So I got to prance around in the mall wearing silks over my jeans waving a Chinese dragon.  The best (and worst) part was where we took the dragon and ran around the performance area.  At the point we were just running around a mall with a dragon.  That was slightly awkward.

Sunday I was feeling a little better so I did basics and 9 section in addition to the dragon.  It was fine except for the aerial (painful) and landing on my whip during the back hops (stupid).

Neal came down and we were supposed to go out or otherwise have a crazy time.  Instead we talked about lifting and then went and got some siquanese food.  Wrapped up the night with the Homestar DVD.  Everybody to the limit.  The limit of excitement.

In other news:

My iPod is full of TMBG as I am prepping for their show at Borders in Tyson's. Everett is coming and is gonna bring his accordion and we are going to try and get John Linnell to sign it.  As well as rock out, 'cause that's what you do when you have an accordion.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Seeing Everett was interesting. Apparently he decided I was cursed, and every time he would come and visit something bad would happen. As far as I can tell he did not experience anything bad this time. I'm not sure what 'bad' had come of him on his previous visits, but it may have involved eating dan dan mien and simply not liking it. He did seem more impressed with my choice of Chinese restaurant this time around. Plus my stunning show of Chinese language skills. Yes, that's right I can convince people that I have Chinese languages skills. Now, I need more skills to back it up.

Everett met me up at borders and we waited around for They Might Be Giants to show up. Wondering around a book store full of TMBG fan with a accordion strapped to your back is fairly fun. Apparently a simple accordion is the ultimate ice breaker in the aforementioned situation, because nobody was shy about striking up conversation with us. We found the line for getting stuff signed, and camped out. Second in line in fact. However as time passed we kept loosing ground. We didn't move, but a number of parents with little kids pushed their way to the front. Then the bookstore employees would tell us that we had to keep a path clear because the band had to get though, so we cleared a path. Pushy parents and their little kids promptly filled in.

I have seen some winy kids in my time, but let me tell you, there is not kid out there as winy as a parent that will push to the front of a book signing line with their 4 year old in tow. They bitched about loosing their spot incessantly. Which didn't make too much sense because they were first in line (this I figured out via deduction: we were #2 in line, they were ahead of us, therefore, they were first).

Once they were finished with their short set, the signing began, and they were rolling. Moving people through there with the efficiency of an ISE designed book signing line. John and John signed the accordion. Linnell stole my silver sharpie, <i>but</i> Everett called his music stupid.

Well, Everett said to Linnell that he has inspired him to create stupid music of his own, and Linnell promptly came back with "you think my music is stupid." Everett back tracked but there was no way out of the hole. Just abandon the silver sharpie and get out of there before you further insult your musical idol. I ran. Everett stayed and plugged his CD, and handed it over to the (extra receptive) John Linnell. I am sure the poop smith swept it up off the floor of Borders later that night.

<hr />

My calf is doing better today; yesterday I was bummed because it wasn't much different from the day before (Which was extra disappointing because Charlie stuck needles in it then). This morning I got up and had little pain at all. I could even stand up on my tippy toes and the gastrocnemius didn't freak out like it had been. However the Medial head is still tender to the slightest touch (thanks to Charlie and his wonderful pain massage techniques). I think training spear last night helped (don't tell Kelly). Worked it out a little, I didn't to any jumps and some of the footwork was painful, but noticed I was feeling better after class than I was before.

Charlie said the injury was Ballet Calf.  Dammit. Way to make me feel better about my injuries.  Why do they have to call it <i>ballet?  How about <i>acrobatic martial ass kicking calf</i>.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Very full weekend.

I slept a lot last night and needed it to recover.  Nikki came up and hung out with us all weekend.

Friday was wushu and no jumps.  Wushu with no jumps is hardly a wushu at all.  My leg is consistently getting better and I would like to try it out tonight and see if I can aerial with no pain.  I am really hoping to get to gymnastics tomorrow and drill the a-twist for a while. I have competition this weekend and haven't been in the physical condition I need to get ready.  Also need to set up some private class time with coach to polish up spear.  So much to do so little time.

Friday was also the birthday Luke Powers.  Who whoulda thought that beej would beat me and Kelly to producing offspring. I mean, we expected Johnny and Sara, but <i>Beej</i>?  We went and saw Beej, Katie, Laura and the shiny new Luke at INOVA.  It was awesome, Katie was beaming, Beej was exhausted and Laura was bouncing around.  Kelly’s clock needs a better snooze button.

We celebrated Kelly's promotion Saturday night.  Fairly sure that some people didn’t understand how big of a deal it is for her to get this, but we had a fun time anyway.  I am impressed that we didn't break anything with the big blue exercise ball.  There were some minor injuries, but nothing big enough for us to stop playing. Even the spontaneous random sibling wrestling was injury free, aside from the bite marks.  Oh, Tom and Ben are no longer allowed behind the bar.  This is not so bad considering they were expecting to be banned from the house.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Arnold's.  Bizarre.

The drive was long, and I wound up driving the entire time (Jason did offer, but I said no).  Getting on the road to head up there at 5 am was tuff, but rolling into town at noon made life easier.  Plus it was worth it so that I see Kelly on Thursday night.

We roll in, go inside to register and check out the craziness in the convention center.  Registration was fairly simple; once they got my $105 they simply gave me a wrist band.  Paula was able to put off registration because she knew one of the ladies that was working the registration desk, so she was able to judge how her knee was feeling before she handed over her cash.

Once everything got sorted out we made our rounds through the vender booths.  I made everyone push their way though the convention center because I wanted to get to the dragon door booth and get some kettle bells -- which turned out to be the furthest booth from the martial arts area possible.  but I got there, and picked up a couple of bells at a nice polite discount.

We wondered aimlessly staring at the many extreme specimens of the human form that were lurking around.  Wearing spandex. Or plastic.  Some wore plastic AND were made out of plastic.  Eventually the hunger forced our curiosity out and we went to find food. Chipotle it was, and one burrito was not enough.  We called the hotel and were able to get a room at the hotel right across the street (parking down town was a <i>pain</i>), went and checked in and unloaded the car.  Paula stayed upstairs and iced her knee while Jason and I went back to watch a few jiujitsu fights.  Crazy fun stuff.  Eventually jordana found us and every one crashed hard.

Up bright and early, events started at 8, according to the registration desk.  We went out, got used to the floor (zebra mats are pretty nice, better than most of the carpet tournaments have) and warmed up. The Chinese team showed up and started taking over the floor, the Americans and Brazilians didn’t take none of that and would jump right in unintimidated.  There was a fair amount of tension at first between the teams, but as time went on and we waited and waited for competition to begin everything cooled down.  By the time we were getting started everyone was cool and joking around.

When competition wasn’t being interrupted by Wesley Snipes’ entourage things went smooth, Nick Gracenin did a great job of running the contemporary divisions.  I think most of us were happy with our performances--even though I think my scores for CQ were, um, a tad low.  Jason covered his stumble after tornado amazingly well and Paula didn’t blow out her knee (everyone was cringing as she busted those low stances).

Once things wrapped up we met up with Y Chan and the OU Wushu Club for a little zhongguofan.  It was mamahuhu at best.  I also thought it weird that the white guy was ordering everything in Chinese.

Everyone wound up going out later that night, I went to a grocery store to buy water and oatmeal cream pies, swung by white castle and chilled in the hotel room watching American Wedding. I was pissy as hell, it was much better that I bailed on going to the club.  Not a big fan of clubbing when I am in a good mood.

I wanted to roll home as soon as possible on Sunday, but Jason and Paula had grands.  They said they would bail if there was no cash prize.  We stayed.  There was no cash prize.  But Paula gets to tell her sponsor that she won grands, and her sponsor will be happy.  The drive home a bit of whammy excitement on the Penn Turnpike.  I won’t say who it was, but it wasn’t me or Jason. We even saw some of the traditional competitors at that very gas station.  Yay!

I got to get me some of the Sequined silks.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Had a private lesson for some spear.  Well Stephon and I split one.  Unfortunately  I didn't get to come up with a new fourth section (I have compulsory ending in there now), but we worked out a lot of the details in sections one and two.  It was really helpful and I made good progress, but then again you always make good progress in the beginning, it's the polishing up process that is make or break for the forms.  I need to have this form done in January, and lo and behold, it's March.

Spear training roasted and toasted my hamstrings, so I had to take it easy during sword.  And I was successful in not causing further injury to my legs.  Once the pain subsides I am gonna hammer the hell out of them with SSLKBDLs!

Once the spear training was completed I did make a run for Eckerd for some instant cold packs and sat with one under my left leg.  The left leg, btw, was the one that gets stressed when you do that little down on one knee spear trick.  Surprisingly today both legs hurt about the same, so I am attributing the ice in the speeded recovery of the seriously strained leg--effectively catching it up to the one I didn't think was hurt at all.

After class we went out for Pho with Mario and Jiang Bang Jun.  After 3 pho places were closed Mario remembered it was Vietnamese super bowl, so we went to Mukee for some Chinese food. I was surprised at the goodness of the food, especially the gān chǎo niú hé (干炒牛河).  That was some good stuff. It was especially cool practicing my Chinese with one of my wushu heros.

No training tonight, I feel like crap.  Crap that has it's head filled with flem.  I prolly shouldn't mention the big ball of flem that I coughed up half way through a full power run of sections one and two.  Had coach yelling to go faster.  I just wanted to run into the bathroom and spit.  It was rather unpleasant.

Now I just wanna take some decongestant and sleep.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Flu

Kelly has the flu for sure, her doctor actually did a test and confirmed it. My doctor thinks I have  asinus infection, but I am not totally convinced.  I have nearly all the same symptoms.  Maybe it's a sinus infection AND the flu.

Either way, life sucks right now.

Kelly's mom is so nice.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Jason called me early last week and said he was going to be in Richmond.  He then proceeded to ask if I wanted to sell my jeep, which had been talked about quite extensively in the past. I said sure and the chaos began.  For starters I had talked about selling it in the past but when it finally came down to it I just couldn't part with the guy.  But this was Jason, so I knew it would be going to a good home, plus he promised us visitation rights.  So we were on.  He got a loan, I gathered all my jeep parts, reinstalled the carpet and cleaned him up real nice.  Saturday the exchange would take place.

Of course that would mean I would be car less, not something that living in the suburbs is conducive to. So I started my search.  The biggest problem was I couldn't decide on which type of vehicle I wanted.  I knew I wanted a slightly used car, with low miles, fur around 20 grand.  I went to car max and narrowed it down to two categories. A small sporty wagon or a pick em up truck.

Traditionally I wanted a small wagon or hatch back.  I like smaller cars and really dig the wagon thing. It's different, useful and I think it looks great.  So I was looking at GTIs and WRXs. Mostly leaning toward the Subaru after that day of pushing cars up an ice covered hill which left me very impressed with the Subaru AWD.

However when I moved I borrowed my dad's F150 and really like the convenience of having the pickup.  After driving it around for a few weeks I decided that I liked the idea, and would just prefer to have a smaller truck.  So I started doing research on midsized trucks.  Boiled down to the Nissan Frontier and the Toyota Tacoma, and every comparison and head to head evaluation I could find had the Toyota coming first and the Nissan second.  I checked out customer reviews, consumer reports dependability rankings, everything and decided that I liked the Toyota the best.

So the actual shopping starts.  I find a nice WRX wagon for $18K, a supercharged Frontier for $17K and a couple of Tacoma's.  I could not decide between the trucks or the wagons.  I tried to have productive conversations about the pros and cons with friends and family and they all said that I should get what I wanted.  I didn't know what I wanted.  Eventually Kelly and I sat down and talked it over (well, I made her do this multiple times) and we came to the conclusion that we have a small sporty wagon so getting another really dosen't help our car-capability-portfolio and the truck makes more since. In these discussions we also determined that we wanted the double cab, as babys are definataly on the horizon and I am not gonna be putting my child in the back of an extended cab (nor in the jeep, which is a MAJOR reason we got rid of it). So double cab it was.

We found that aforementioned Frontier for $17 and it was looking pretty nice, until I sent josh the carmax link and he caught onto the fact that it was 2wd.  Even the car I was looking at powered all its wheels; I was going to get a truck with 4wd. On Wednesday when we found that Frontier Kelly also pointed out a 02 Tacoma double cab, 4X4 and V6 everything, but they wanted $21, 999; which felt a little steep to me.  I looked around, drove to a couple of used Toyota dealers in the area and test drove some stuff.  The closet thing I found was a black 02 Tacoma, low miles but it was a work truck and treated as such.  The bed was scratched and dinged up a bit.  Still had drywall scraps in the tail gate hinge.  I insisted on knowing the final out-the-door price so I got to sit down with the sales man's manager and he kept trying the <i>what'll it take to get you in this truck today</i> thing.  I was sitting pretty with my list of truck (location, miles, and price) and held all the advantage.  It was the best interaction I had ever had with a used car salesman ever.  Basically I owned him, and he danced around trying to do whatever he could to make me happy.  I wanted the broken badge removed, I wanted the final price, it was too high make it lower.  The sticker on the truck said $25,999, internet price was 22K, he said I could get it for 21 and some change, out the door.  I was happy I passed on it.

Because that next day that nice silver 02 Tacoma at carmax had been reduced by a grand.  I am pretty sure they have some sophisticated algorithm for reducing their costs based on how long the car had been on the lot. I had one call in to some guy named Harold that was supposed to be getting a new dark grey 02 double cab that day.  After waiting for hours for him to call me back (I tried to talk to someone else at that dealer, but my Spanish wasn't good enough) only to find out that it was 2wd.  That was it, I decided I wanted to buy that silver one.  Called in my drive-me-to-carmax-so-I-can-buy-a-car favor form Ben and we were off. I even called the carmax guy who showed it to us on Wednesday to talk to him again but he was off that day, so he stepped up, called ahead and arranged to have someone waiting for us when we showed.  Other than getting my address wrong on the first credit application everything went smoothly and I bought the truck right there.

Pretty good, bought the truck on Friday and was on my way to give the jeep to Jason the very next day.  Of course Kelly had to drive the truck down to Richmond so that 'rents could check out the new wheels. She said she felt comfortable in it, no apprehension at all--opposed to the jeep where she was always a little nervous driving it.

I gave Jason the down-low on the jeep, all the little things I had done to it, and its quirks; showed him how to take the top down and a few of the other little tricks.  Kelly was worried that Jason wasn't excited about the jeep, but as Lisa could attest it was Jason simply not emoting.  I am pretty sure he is thrilled with everything.  I am certain I gave him a great price on a good jeep.  And as long as he is able to drive it to Atlanta with no issues I think I will feel pretty good. I would feel horrible if he broke down right after buying it off me.

Kelly seemed to have some separation issues, as we were able to determine by her clinging to the seat and crying.  But Jason reassured her and promised to take good care of Teddy.

Which brings me to another problem:  I have to name the new truck.  We name all our cars after presidents.  The prelude was Grover Cleveland, the civic was FDR, the Jetta is Eisenhower and the Jeep was Teddy Roosevelt. Now what to name the Tacoma?  I thought 'Ford' would be a good name for a pickup, but seems inappropriate for this one. This is going to require a bit of research.

<i>Damn, two pages already, no way I am going to proof read all that, much less fix the chronological errors.  Eh, you get the point. </i>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Quads are sore enough that I cannot walk correctly.  I can walk with out pain but I lock out my knees all strange.  When I do try to talk normally I feel it real good.  Result of the frog jumps (5X5) and the pistols (2X5) after wushu on Monday.  A fun way to come back after 2 weeks of slacking.

Yesterday Stephon and I shared a private class on spear.  I am pretty sure coach tried to kill us.  I could tell I was trying hard because of the dry heaves and the uncontrollable shaking.  Coach said that when they were training back in the day shaking was the norm, if you could use chopsticks after training you didn't train hard enough. Fun stuff.

Hopefully we can keep up this private class thing for a while, only we are gonna have to move it to another day-Tuesday is for gymnastics and there is no way I am going to have the energy to flip after 2 wushu classes. The quality of training is light years ahead of the normal evening classes.  Mmm-mmm pukie.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Interesting drive home on friday.

I was pulling up to the light getting ready to turn into our neighborhood and smelled something a little strange.  A burning-chemical-fluid type smell.  As a slowed for the light I noticed my brake peddle was getting pushed down a bit further than normal.  When it hit the floor I kinda got spooked, but I was able to pump the brakes and get it to stop in time.  As I pumped the brakes that wonderful burning brake fluid smell got oh-so-much stronger.

I was really lucky in that it happened as I was pulling into my neighborhood, at a stoplight with no cars in front of me, and I could coast nice and slow until I got home (pumping the brakes along the way).

I called carmax and informed the nice lady that answered the phone that I wanted to get my truck towed there and she informed me that the service department was closed and I should call back on Monday.  I didn't like this idea and started getting annoyed until she admitted to having no power and connected me to a sales manager.  This was good. Mina helped me out.  As soon as I told her "I bought a car there a week ago and the brakes went out today" she got real apologetic and helpful.  Offered to send a tow truck out right away and get it back there so they could hop on it as soon as possible.  She even helped me out when I called back an hour and a half later wondering where the truck was (I was told 30-45 min) and called and harassed the tow company.

This morning I called carmax and spoke to the service people, after sitting on hold for a while I finally got through and they seemed helpful but havn't actually done anything yet.  At least that I know of.  I was promised a call from Taylor once the tech had a chance to look at it.  I did get a call from them this morning wanting more details on the problem and I basically told him I needed a new master cylinder. I called him a little after noon and he said they were out to lunch and woudl give me a call in an hour.  It's quarter to 3 now. Bah.

I was really hoping they could get this dealt with today, but looks like it is going to be at least tomorrow before I can get her back.  the good part is they are responsible for making everything work and getting it in tip top shape.  the bad part is the brakes went out and I don't have my truck.  Poor, poor truck.

Cats are nuts.

Ok, henry was a bit odd last night.  He was sitting with us in the foof just being all cute and snuggly.  when he got spooked.  He perked up and started looking around and she Ampere slowly strolled into the room Henry flipped.  Just went psycho.  We tried to calm him and he wasn't having it.  Kelly got scratched real good on her belly.  My right ear was bleeding on the inside.  And henry was all poofed up and archy.  Paranoid for the rest of the night.  Kelly was a bit hurty on the belly.

Kelly was worried, I am pretty sure they had another cat-in-the-back-yard experience.  they did seem to be shedding alot.  Also we are pretty sure they don't like the hairball/weightless cat food Kelly got for them.  Not that Kelly meant to buy it.  Oh, but they do like to eat ham.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Skipped wushu last night, to hang out with Kelly and stop by tom's new place.

But I did start a new leg program (Pavel's hot wheels by summer) so I don't feel like too much of a slacker. My upper left hamstring is a little sore today, however I think that may just be a wushu injury aggravated by lifting.  I'll take it easy tonight in spear class (none of those half split movements I have in my form), and I won't be going before classes to train with Stephon.  But I will be in spear class and it's gonna be fast-hands for me. Oh, Stephon showed coach Shi Kun's 2004 spear form and she seems to think that would be a good one for me, which I find funny because my first section used to be based entirely on his.  When I explained this to coach she said that I must have done a poor job copying it. Don't know if I am going to try to change mine, because I am starting to get used to it and it is all original.  And original is better than biting from some Chinese guy.  Even if that Chinese guy is my wushu hero.

Tom's house was really nice.  But Tom and Meredith didn't let us help out with anything, which is the main reason we went over there.  I realize they were being nice by not asking for help, but that's how we got everything done on our house when we moved in so I figure I owe it to help people out with theirs.  Something trite like pay-it-forward/sew-as-you-reap/karma.  They need to get a puppy now, methinks. Oh, and a trampoline.

Kelly is going to NJ this weekend, which sucks.  I hope I get my truck back before this weekend, 'cause that has sucked too.  Get this:  I have not had my truck for as long as I have had it.  Assuming you don't count the time I didn't have it when I had it.  I will buy the parts and take them there.  C'mon peoples.]]></content:encoded>

10. Someone yells "first post," but they aren't reading slashdot.
9. Everyone refers to each other by their instant messenger names.
8. You give the groom "Sam's Teach Yourself Tantric Love-making in 28 Days."
7. You are the only human male in a hot tub full of female Klingons, but you are skinnier than all of them.
6. None of the friends are able to provide the groom with any first-night tips based on their own experience.
5. When the stripper asks, if you have protection, you show her your firewall.
4. Someone yells "bang tail" in order to indicate a shell command should be repeated in order to view a log file.

2. Attendees reminisce about the good times they had in Ultima Online.
1. Frequent cries of "[I'm going to shoot Magic Missiles at the darkness!](http://www.fuzzymonk.com/media/dungeons-and-dragons-part1.mp3)"

#'s 11, 10, 4 and 1: classic. Needed some H*R related ones too.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Spring forward to grilling.

By far the best part of this week was playing hooky from wushu and busting out the lump charcoal, the stove pipe starter and the grill. I just decided I needed another day of rest and some time to chill with Kelly.  While we were discussing what we were going to do for the evening at the grocery store (which I volunteered to go to, BTW) we decided we needed to have the first grill of ought-five.  We called Tom and He was all about it, so he dragged Meredith out of bed came over.   I think the girls had one burger and one dog each, so Tom and I polished off a solid 9 units of grilled meat foods.

We didn't even make it inside with the food.  We weren't outside either.  Mostly we sat in the doorway for the sliding glass door and ate.  The Bar and plenty of stools and lawn chairs were near by, but we had our priorities.

Yesterday was a bit more eventful.  And by eventful a lot of unfun things happened.  I put kelly's gym bag and her suitcase in her car to be nice.  I didn't put her laptop bag in there, assuming we didn't want to leave that in the car overnight.  Apparently she does that now.  About the time I got to Ballston I got a call pointing out that I didn't put her laptop bag in her car.  Yeah, tell me something I don't know.  Um, she didn't put it in either, which I didn't know, and drove to Richmond.  She sent some emails and found a nice co worker to bring it down to her.  Only problem was I had to drive form Ballston to burke to McLean to get it to her buddy.  I like to call him Rajie.  Work was lacking as Dr. Ross said he is going to be a super nerd, dumb ben (笨) officially announced his intentions to break up with us.

I finally wrapped things up by getting to wushu early hanging out and doing sword class.  Decent class, and coach actually had some good corrections there at the end for my sections.  The gist: go faster.  That simple.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Wushu friday night was pretty good.  Then we trained for the demo on saturday, everything was gong well.  I got through all the hard training and we switched to weapons.  Since we had a demo that night I did 9 section, so everythign was a peice of cake.  I went the first time with some suckiness, so I asked coach if I could go again at the end, and when I was done my right calf was hurting.  Sounds like what I had [before](http://www.fuzzymonk.com/chris/log/2005/02/mysterious-calf-injury.php). Big bad ballet calf.  It does not seem as bad, but I am gonna be real nice to it for a while and see how it goes.

In other news game night was fun and the wife has been bronzed. In some neat streaks and spots.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I skipped wushu last night to let my calf recover.

Instead I lifted in the afternoon with the workers and then hit up home depot for some lawn care stuff.  Grass seed, fertilizer, ant killer, the usual.

Headed home to find that Ben beat me there--which I expected.  The plan was to install his XM antenna and wash my car. Once we went to work on his XM stuff we got carried away and I knew I wasn't going to wash my car.  So I think at this point Ben owes me a car washing.  But I was pretty happy with the quality of the installation, it was nice and clean.  The antenna wire was run very well hidden, as we popped off numerous interior body panels and shoved it up in the ceiling. Wiring the power was a bit more of a hack, but we crimped in the connections to the cigarette lighter and the power outlet on the dash, I would have preferred to splice into the back of the radio (radio stuff wired into the radio, makes since), but didn't want to screw up the radio attempting to splice things in.  Part of the problem is I don't know if there is a way to splice things other than to cut them and crimp them back together.  I would have preferred to solder it, but I don't like the idea of soldering anything while it is in the dash of a car.  Oh, and I want one of them [cold heat soldering irons]( https://www.asseenontvnetwork.com/vcc/coldheat/coldheat/115802/).

Eventually we were able to trick Tom into coming over simply by telling him to come over a bunch of times.  Either that or his wife fell asleep and he was bored. We went to Armand's and got pizza and wings.  Proper way of finishing up a night of skipping wushu.]]></content:encoded>

Note to wife: <i>I am very sorry I ruined your fun basement, as it is a scary weight room with a giant foof.</i>

Oh, and if anyone wants some standard weight plates (oh, say 235 lbs of them), a EZ curl bar, big ol' bench with preacher, or a beafy leg press let me know.  Cause I have them, and they sure are runinin' my wife's basement.  Quick.  She gets home today. I better go hide.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last night was fun.

Sort of a pregoing away for Ben.  We came back to my place to washed and waxed our trucks before I had to run off to wushu.  Ben went over and hung at Tom's new place (which reminds me I need to change my answering machine) while I trained.  By the time I was able to get back home Kelly was up from Richmond and lightly toasted.  They already had the grill going and we were prepping for some serious eating.  Something like 23 meat units. It was great hanging out in the basement.

I think Kelly was rather annoyed at my gym in her media room. I walked in the door and the first thing I heard was that the rack was BIG.  I think she cam around and once I was able to begin the cost offsetting by getting Josh to buy a bunch of plates, a barbell and 4 (count 'em 4) dumbbell handles for a mere $50.  Yeah, they might be used weights, but they are still heavy.

Wushu was actually pretty good.  I wanted to take it easy on the nandu because my calf still feels a little discomfort.  But I eased up on any left leg jumps (read: aerials) and was able to do a-twists with no pain.  I was very happy we started with sections 3 and 4 as those gave me time to get psyched up before doing 1 and 2 with all their difficulty.  Couple of things I need to work on: Jump side rotation must make the full 540, i've been a little shy on when I go for the mabu landing. A-twist must get vertical, I have been tending to lean on it some, the right leg is vertical but the left tends to go around on the side. And Qipo.  Yeah, yeah--well it still needs work.

China trip is looking very shaky (no word on TT). And coach is flying in some fancy pants rules/choreo/nandu coach for some extended private training, so that may be my china trip this year.  Bah.  (However that means seeing Kelly AND training)]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Baseball, yard work, wushu and even a little charcoal scorched food.

Yep, it was a good weekend.  I think it was Friday and Kelly started stressing over when we were going to get some time to hang out with each other, thinking the weekend was booked and we were going to repeat a Tuesday-Wednesday on a Saturday-Sunday (!).  But then came baseball, Danny and Chris gave us their tickets for the second home game and it was a chilly night but a total blast.  When we left the Nats were up 9-0, and the final score was 9-3.  Stupid Arizona, they were supposed to get shutout.  It was just me and the wife, plus some hotdogs (which took some serious conviction to stand in line for)

Kelly's concern was because she was originally she was supposed to be in Waldorf Saturday day and in Baltimore on Sunday night.    Luckily we had some good old baseball time Saturday but she was going to miss the grilling with Tom, Meredith, Ben and Ben.  She was able to get out of going to Baltimore, which is a damn good thing because the house was a wreck and she cleaned it while I tore up the yard.  Plus she was able to see everyone when they came over.  Too bad Tom and Mer didn't make it, they had some sort of painting-the-bathroom mishap and were working past midnight.  The rest of us had a decent time and we even had a bonus Sean since he came over to help me with the yard.

Sean was bored Saturday evening and came over to play with the cats.  Who apparently do not deal with intruders in any assertive way.  Sean had to go looking for them and was only able to track down Ampere.  Henry came wondering out after a little while to see what all the noise was about.  This blossomed into playing some ratchet and clank, which I am sure was thrilling for the cats.  That bloomed into motion sickness and Sean decided that was enough of that.

Mario is back at O-Mei, and we are all making an assertive effort to keep the competitive people tight and on good terms.  Everyone is training hard now, and adding another good and serious wushu freak to the mix is only a good thing.  Working on nandu a lot and right now I am feeling pretty good, my only real complaint is my shins.  I am trying some running technique changes and jump rope to see if I can help that.  I didn't realize it until recently but my form for running is disgusting--especially in wushu.  Mostly just pound the hell out of my heels, which cannot help my lower legs.  I have noticed that when I jump rope I really feel the muscles where my shins hurt (more of a burn than a hurt type of feel).  So I am going to try to build up nice and slowly to some slow running and jump roping while concentrating on being light and controlling my form. I will prolly keep up with my KB foot curls but I am feel that they don't really help.

I lifted with the new equipment yesterday.  A real abbreviated workout, just bench press and squats--it was a little over an hour before wushu so I didn't want to be toasted for training.  Felt good, the cage feels pretty solid.  Still can't figure out how much the bar weighs.  I tried using Kelly's kitchen scale, but all it tells me is 'E'.  So perhaps the bar weighs 2.718lbs (SHUT UP NERD!).]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I dropped 85lbs of iron plates this morning.  Made a horrific crash.  Really loud.  Seriously spooked the cats, they freaked out and got all poofy in the tail.  They were also very suspicious of each other.

I was simply unracking the weights from the bar not thinking at all.  So once I removed all the plates from one side the other was heavier than the bar and decided to slowly drop until the bar on my side hit the celing (the low part where the I-beam is), at which point the plates slid off the bar, bounced off the wall (I got the big black streaks to prove it) and crashed on top of the kettle bells and the dumbells I have piled up down there.  No one got hurt.  Kelly got a little scared but I yelled out "I'm ok"  and followed it with a soft spoken "dumb, but ok".

We all know the lesson here: never lift with cats.  The only exception being Ampere flys.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[This weekend was nice save for the pain in my shoulder*.

My parents called Saturday morning and said they wanted to come up for lunch.  They didn't want to stay too long, but that worked out because we were planning to have dinner with Beej and fam that night.  So the 'rents came up and we had a nice dinner at Sweetwater.  My father said that we should be able to do the bar sink with out too much trouble, which is some good news.  He also said we should be seeing some grass sprout in the back yard this week, so I am on the look out for new growth.

Went over to Beej and Katie's and as an added bonus Andy and Anne were down form NY so they went with use to dinner.  Austin Grill had a huge wait and we had an infant, so we went to Tiyuki Grill instead.  From the sound of it (and the sushi posters) I thought it was going to be a Japanese restaurant, but I overheard them and it was Chinese.  So I put down the confusing English menu and just started asking if they had what Kelly and I wanted.  Gan bian si ji dou and tui pi niu, plus I completely understood talking the lady.  I left there with a bunch of impressed college buddies and a swollen head.  I must be allergic to tui pi niu and it caused my head to swell up.

Sunday we owned Tom's microwave. Well Tom owns it, but we schooled it in...it being installed...by us. Installation was much easier than I thought it was going to be.  Tom called me over to help, mostly to take care of the electrical wiring.  I must say I am really proud of the installation now that is it finished.  We got a socket box, a socket, and a face plate from Home Depot and wired them up as per the instructions on the lil box (the bare wire to the green screw).  Now that everything is finished I really feel like it was a professional quality wiring job. Heck, the only less the professional aspect to the entire project was the drilling of a dozen holes in an inch-and-a-half circle on the cabinet shelf to cram the microwave's power cable through.  And that was only because we didn't have a 2" drill bit. Looks good, matches the brand and the color of the rest of the appliances.  IMO, makes the rest of the appliances look newer and nicer.

* I don't know what I did to tweak it, but it was hurting all weekend and it felt pretty good this morning till I tried to bench press. Hurts when I raise my arms out to the side with my elbow bent and the arm forward palm down.]]></content:encoded>

<title>From chicken parm to twinkimisu</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Work has been crazy, one guys quits an inevitably all the stuff he was working on has issues.  Well, maybe not all, but 3 of the big programs.  And because of this I haven't had time to write about Monday.

Monday I wound up skipping wushu because of my shoulder, and since I was home tom decided to run over to my house and I could drive him back.  I got over there and eventually called Kelly and said she should just come on over.  Meredith made Chicken Parm, and no matter what she says I liked it.  It included sitting around on the kitchen floor eating chips and queso as well as large ass-welts from pasta fazzoli. On Tom and Meredith was the one wielding the aforementioned pasta fork. Afterwards Mer made us go get some ice cream, and I called Ross to see if that would fall under the WWRE plan.  No dice.  I announced to everyone in dairy queen that Ross won't let us eat ice cream.  I just has some of Kelly's so that clearly doesn't count.

I trained a little in the afternoon on Tuesday but my shoulder was hurting so I didn't train at night.  Instead I went running, lifted and then went to gymnastics with Tom.  I hadn't been to the gym in a while and Tom mostly wanted to play so that is what we did.  It included things like running down the power tumbling strip and abruptly falling on the mats at the end.  Carlos strapped Tom into the spotting belt and had him practice back tucks.  He can do a back flip pretty easy, but wanted to make it a cleaner back tuck.  This also lead to a couple of interesting crashes later.  Front tucks off the power tumbling strip over large foam stuff was fun.

Wednesday I trained at night and didn't have too much to put into it.  My calves were very sore from running and my shins were killing e from all the front tucks.  But I made it out and moaned about my soleuses (<i>Ooohh, my soleuses...</i>).  Shoulder was my real concern and it was fine.

Yesterday I trained with Stephan in the afternoon and I was feeling pretty good.  He was a fairly grumpy because (in a strange turn of events) the one that was hurt.  We think it is Achilles tendonitis--and he just kept saying how he didn't need this now. We have competition soon.  I could relate. Spear was good and coach pushed pretty hard.  The 2 full sets at the end were killer; I thought I was going to throw up.

I actually felt pretty good and hung around at O-Mei for a while.  But we were planning on grilling again so I wound up leaving around 6.  I gave the wife a call and was actually ahead of her, went to the grocery store and I still beat her home.  Kelly and Meredith made Twinkimisu for desert.

<title>Coach tried to kill me</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[My shoulder still bothers me some, and sword is by far the hardest on it.  I have to have alot of movements that require me to have my arm rotated medially and extended and that is pretty much the only thing that hurts.  Surprisingly spear does not hurt. Bench press does.

Coach tried to kill me yesterday.  Me and Stephon, actually.  We showed up to train in the afternoon and stuck with spear the entire time.  Coach was a little late but we were warmed up and ready to go when she walked in the door.  We started with two whole line drills and went right into sections.  Started with triple section fours.  Then moved onto two sections.  I seriously thought I was going to vomit.  It was harder than any of the team stuff form two years ago, because there was only two of us.  Shaky, weak, nauseating, super fun.

I then taught an intro lesson and trained at 7.  I was supposed to go to gymnastics, Tom and Vyvy both said they were going to go, but by the end I was dead, and Vyvy didn't push for it so I didn't make it.

Work is actually going fairly well, this “hey this guy is leaving so you get a pseudo-promotion and lots of work” thing is surprisingly good.  Maybe it’s just the office.  The big-lonely-all-by-my-self-but-with-a-place-for-someone-else-to-sit office.  Well I don’t talk about work here so n’mind.

I now have 7 min to decide:  Italian, Chicken Parm (today’s special) or Other.  Honestly, WWRE.  And don’t say salad bar, please. I think I am getting tired of iced tea.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Does Cinco de Mayo fall on the fifth day of the week on the fifth year of the century.  We celebrated by going to Tom's drinking some customized margaritas and grating enormous amounts of cheese.  We also watched two hours of the O.C. and Kelly convinced they Dougherty's that I love that show.  No matter what I say, to them, I love it.

Damn you the O.C.!  First it was some music, but now you have ruined my reputation.

Shhh, don't you worry, I did train at 4. However coach and Stephon didn't show up, so it was just me. And Johnson, but he was pretending to be a librarian. I actually trained fairly hard, and I wanted to train with the intermediate class, but coach was preoccupied with some phone calls and Stephon didn't run the class in a manner conducive to me working in.   I did come up with some new choreo in spear to help my section 2-3 transition.  More throws for me.

Demo at the [ Mandarin Oriental](http://www.mandarinoriental.com/hotel/535000001.asp) tomorrow.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I spent the better part of my Saturday in the basement back room at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in DC.  We hung out at O-Mei for quite some time after the Saturday class, during which time Kelly and the McHugh’s got to take a super fun trip to Fuddruckers.  Eventually everyone we needed showed up and we were able to drive on up to the metro.  Stephon and I got the illustrious position of playing parents to 5 energy filled (mostly) Chinese wushu kids.  It was not a calm quiet metro ride.  But we did have a hang from the bar contest.  Peter won.

We eventually showed up at the hotel, met with the lady that was organizing the entire thing and she showed us to our little back room, and promised to bring us some food. The food never showed but we had managed to change into our silks, and go out and find some cater waiters to steal food from.  As time rolled on, and we noticed we had been in that little back room for a few hours we decided to bring up the 6:30 start time that was given on the schedule.  Instead we got told we go on at 8:20 and had a repetitive explanation of how the schedule page was formatted for extra confusion.

We found the stage manager at this point.  Asked for food.  So as he ran like crazy through the halls we tried to gather the rest of the kids together.  Who, upon hearing we had acquired more food decided that they would quickly consume the delicious horderves they had pilfered form the kitchen.  I noticed once we got in the elevator that not everyone had come along, instead they were headed the wrong direction through the crowded cocktail room.  Yelling for them to come back at a prim and proper black tie affair was only slightly awkward.  Eventually we found our way to room 311 and got some Styrofoam containers full of food.  The rumbling in my belly rejoiced.  We went back to the room and cracked them bad boys open.  It was full of cold un-good Chinese food.  I ate some of my chicken and rice and my hardboiled tea egg, but I didn’t like it too much. Eventually we sent some ninjas on a mission and they returned with 2 plates full of the food they were serving for the main function.  Tasty salmon and some super good chicken.  Portions were small, but we were fairly full from the not-so-good stuff.

Almost as soon as we ate we were called up for our flag holding job.  We rearranged, reviewed exactly how we were going to do it (we had rehearsed this to death, all we were going to do was hold some flags, well we were going to do it flawlessly).  As we lined up back stage for the last time the stage manager changed everything.  Didn’t matter too much because no one told the MC, who would of screwed us up no matter if we did our originally rehearsed plan on this last minute one that was dumped on us.  It wasn’t our fault that is looked busted, but it was still us up on stage looking confused.

We waited and exceptionally long time in our little room for everyone to gather their stuff and change.  We finished up our stay with 3 of our kids attempting to run up the escalator the wrong way.  One of the girls fell right as she was reaching the top. Security never approached us, but then again I sorta headed straight outside as this was going on.

Long, but much more calm metro ride home.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[So the day was going pretty well.  I did decide to go to the client in the city and there was heavy traffic, but the morning went fairly well.  We even went to get some Thai food for lunch.

But then I had to leave early for the Dentist.  I was scheduled for a cleaning, and I figured I would go ahead and get the impressions for the night guard that he wanted me to get.  First up was the impressions, administered by a big tuff lady who commented that I had "woohooo quite and arch" and went and got these huge metal trays to fill full of pink rubbery goo and shove in my mouth.  I knew it wasn't going to be pleasant when she started asking about my gag reflex.  I concentrated and was able to suppress any unwanted reflexes but the experience was fairly unpleasant--especially when she was trying to remove the tray around my upper teeth, it really felt like she was going to yank all my teeth out of the top.  That would have made for a great day.

The cleaning was uneventful.  It is never fun to have someone scrape your teeth with that metal thing only to follow up by cutting your lips and gums with their bully tactics flossing technique.

Then I was faced with the bill.  A whopping $680 for the night guard.  They told me a year ago that it was going to be about $100.  I was not too happy about this.  I didn't raise too much of a fuss, but I was very upset.  I wanted to keep my $700.  But no.  I volunteered to have them take it away.

I tried to call Kelly.  Didn't answer.  I tried again she answered but was preoccupied at what ever she was doing at work (sounded like a loud meeting).  I shouted some curse words, which helped a little.  As I was sitting in traffic on my way to O-Mei I decided to bail into 7 corners for coffee and I guess the lady could tell I was upset, so she gave me a free drink.  I didn't even realize it at first and tried to pay the guy.  I did go find her again and tell her thanks.  Everything was good until the caffeine from that drink wore off.  We had a great spear class.  I went and got some food and come back for the 7 o'clock class.  Everything was going well until I was on my 3rd rotation of section 1 in sword.  I went to jump for the butterfly and my calf had a very noticeable pain.  Then the twist.  Yep sure hurts.  I made doubly sure by doing the jump outside.  Didn't land it real well and sorta hopped off the floor.  That was it for me that night.  I iced it a little and stretched.  I headed home very annoyed at the lost $700 and the possibility that I may not be training anymore this week.

I rolled up to the house and heard the smoke detector going off.  So I flipped.  I ran in, no smoke.  Ran upstairs, no smoke.  The smoke alarm was going going off.  I actually couldn't tell where the alarm was coming from.  I went back to the main floor.  It was louder down there, but still couldn't tell where it was coming from.  With my powers of deduction I determined it must be downstairs.  I entered the utility room and yep, it was there.  The carbon monoxide detector.  I gathered up the cats and hurried up stairs.  Called Kelly who happened to be with my parents and asked what I should do.  I knew it had something to do with checking the furnace-which hasn't been run in weeks, but I was at a loss.  Once I was talking on the phone with my dad I went back down to inspect. I figured if I passed out he could call some nice emergency response team to come get me.

I reentered the utility room and shut the door behind me to make sure the cats couldn't follow me in.  I did notice a strange smell, but it is the utility room so I don't think too much of it.  I inspect the furnace, and check out the hot water heater.  Everything looks normal.  Electronic ignition.  No smell of gas.  I look over next to the washer and dryer and notice that there is blue paint on the floor.  The strangest thing.  It is bright blue, not like any paint we have.  I also notice there are dead bugs in it.  How reassuring.  I dab my finger in it and very cautiously smell it.  Tide.  It is a bunch of Tide Laundry detergent. We had a huge thing of liquid tide sitting on the back of the dryer and it kinked the container making a hole.  You would be surprised how much floor space 2.65 gallons of tide can cover with a quarter inch of detergent.   I start pulling back the carpet. It is everywhere, under the washer dryer, under the big cooler, and some buckets.  I grab the broom and try to sweep it.  It was a stroke of genius really, to choose the broom.  When there was a perfectly good mop in the room too, but I opted for the broom. In the end it was more fun because it caused way more suds.  And after a day like this I needed some bubbles to make things better.

While cleaning while on the phone was fun I decided it was getting late so I should run to Target and get a new carbon monoxide detector.  I didn't know how old the current one was and thought it would be a good test.  So I went and got one, and picked up a coily hose for the front yard while I was out.  Went and paid.  Came home.  Noticed that the old one was going off again. I took the hose out of the bag and the detector was not in it.  So I went back to target, getting there just as they were about to close and got it from the nice lady in the service center.  Returned home and plugged it in.  No sounds.  I figured it might take a few min, but nothing.  Waited a bit more, occasionally going down stairs to check the digital readout, which continued to read zero.  So I finally got to work cleaning up the Tide.  Even got to use my new hose.  Le me tell you, a painted concrete floor gets real slippery when you spray water on the 1/4 inch of detergent.  I used the broom to sweep it toward the recently unclogged drain.  The jet setting on the sprayer and combined with the intermittent sweeping actions on my part resulted in suds of bubble bath proportions.  I had fun trying to flush off the floor, while keeping the water away from the carpet and other clothes and trying to direct it in the direction of the drain.  The designers of the house probably thought it would be funny to slope the floor behind the washer and dryer to a spot a bout 2 feet in front of the dryer next to the wall.  It all wanted to pool there.  So I swept it away.  I tried to sweep behind the dryer and decided the only way to get everything up was to move the dryer.  A super slippery floor, combined with my soap covered hands and feet made moving the smooth metal dryer tricky. But I did it and was able to spray and spray away the detergent.  I decided to put it back in place and move the washer next.  The washer is much heavier. In fact with my current Mu-sub-S I was unable to move it but an inch or two.  I was however able to place it directly on top of my big toe.  You don't tend to remember that you have no friction the help out when you are in a pain induced scramble to save a toe.

Eventually I just get tired and stop.  Standing on the slippery concrete makes my back get real tight and my calf wasn't too happy with having to do stuff.  So I just went to bed.

I guess toxic fumes make cats hyper because they decided to do wind sprints from the office to the bedroom.  I shut the door.  I'd be willing to bet it was Amp that hit it.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[This last weekend was a lot of firsts. First real bachelor party would do that I guess.  I think in the end I was a little bitter I never had one, even though I don't think I would want one on quite the same scale as this.

I think we put an end to the single life of our friend properly.

<img src="http://www.fuzzymonk.com/albums/Vegas2005/DSC03009.thumb.jpg" align="left">When we first got there we found Batchelor #1's brother and they wanted to gamble after we had our dinner but D and I didn't think that was such a fun idea so we decided to see what we could find on the strip. So we walked it.  The whole thing-twice! It was something like 3 or 4 hours of going into hotel after hotel and discovering yet another casino exactly like the one before.  We were at a loss, wanted to find something different but it all seemed to be the same.  Walking directly out of the frontier everything to the right was Disneyland and to the left was a Boardwalk at the shore.

<img src="http://www.fuzzymonk.com/albums/Vegas2005/DSC03012.thumb.jpg" align="right">The next day we spent the morning on the phone trying to find golf.  After a bunch of calls and enlisting help from Roommates back home and local cousins we found a public course and for about $100 we were able to play 18 holes.  Even got a cart.  I got really good at getting in and out while it was still in motion.  It took nearly 6 and a half hours for us to finish, we were really slow golfers.  But to our credit there was the pool girls and the cats.  The cats were the cool part.

Picture the African wilderness, or a safari special on the discovery channel, the lionesses stalking gazelle.  Well replace that exact image with two house cats on a golf course stalking some pigeons.  We had a couple of seasoned hunters mocking the felines for their lack of cover, stalking in the open until on of the birds gets spooked and starts to take off, so the cat rushes.  Leaps up and snatches a creature of nearly its own size right out of the air.  Everyone was awe struck.  Except me, I saw a little stalking and the cat running a ways with a flapping bird in its clutches but the cool part happened during my back swing.

<img src="http://www.fuzzymonk.com/albums/Vegas2005/DSC03022.thumb.jpg" align="right">We wondered to a few casinos and even checked out the brand new Wynn hotel before grabbing lunch.  Afterwards we gambled a bit, hung around and eventually went to a...um...bar and got the man some pricy drinks.  It was a long night, and for some it involving some sleeping on the cold bathroom tile.

Overall it was pretty good.  I am a real conservative (read: boring) gambler, but I did have company.  At one point we tried to get change for two (count 'em two!) dimes so we could play nickel slots.  The casino didn't take dimes.

I liked playing Pi Gao Poker, and the first night I laid down a whopping fourty bucks and came out with sixty.  The next day I returned to the same table and promptly lost my fresh new $20. So I would have broke even had it not been for a dollar in change (which was given to me) that I was able to turn into ten on some quarter slots.  That, sir, was just silly.  I was laughing the entire time.  Which form what I could tell was not the normal thing to do while at the slots.  We tried to slouch and look disinterested, but we thought it was too damn funny.

Right before our flight back we saw Ka.  I really liked it.  It had a lot of wushu and the stage/auditorium was amazing.  Honestly I like their traveling shows better.  And I think it is because it puts more emphasis on the performer's skill and not the technical marvels that large sums of money can build. The wushu was good, and when we were not wasting time on plot development I was very entertained.  Those shadow puppets were unbelievable. I don't care what anyone else says, I liked the baton girl--contact juggling with a baton is coolness in my book.

Red eye flights suck.  It was nearly as bad as the flight to china. Monday afterwards was a very rough day.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[The weekend was nuts.

We started out by getting up and heading over to the Dougherty’s for breakfast.  It was a tidal wave of breakfast fun.  Breakfast Burritos, Waffles, Bacon, Sausage, Bagels—you name it.  After stuffing our selves we hopped in the Jetta and headed south. Drive down was pretty nice, no where near the 4 hours that the mean neighbor insisted.

A bit of excitement on 295 though.  Went zipping past a speed trap.  Checked the rear view mirror and the cop started to roll.  Damn.  We got over and slowed down nice and polite.  The first of the 3 cars in that were in our bunch was long gone; I think he stepped on it when he saw the cop roll. We got over to the right lane; the red car behind us was in the next one over.  The cop pulled up next to us and we thought we were done for.  We slowed down and he stayed with the red car and it’s huge rottweiler (head out the window, giving the cruiser a mean look) and pulled them.  Tom cheered, I was still shaking, and we were very conservative for the rest of the drive.

We got down, got the room and got Chic-Fil-a.  Got it?  Eventually we found the rest of the coworker peoples, well, ex-coworkers. Hung out for a while and eventually we all went and got ready for the wedding.

The actual ceremony was a nice polite protestant wedding. We jumped in the cars and rushed back to the hotel, calling the cabs on the way.  Three cabs was overkill, I think.  And they all were going off about how far the trip was.  It was a total of 9 miles, and they were bitching saying “yeah, maybe once you get to <i>that</i> town”.  In the end it was 9 miles and less than $20 a cab ride.

<img src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/blog/image/595/ryan_reception.jpg" align="right" />Leah’s Parent’s house was amazing.  It was right on the Chesapeake Bay with the entire backyard being a peninsula that jutted out into the bay.  It was gorgeous, sail boats anchored just off shore and a little boat house bar for her dad.  They had a band and a dance floor set up in the back, just a few feet form the water, tents for sitting, and tents full of food.  My personal favorite was the tend with the local BBQ place serving some tasty grub.

The combination of the cold and the open bar lead to a good deal of silliness.   I got into the habit of ordering cocktails with out ice so that we wouldn’t get any colder.  Eventually they kicked in and we were no longer cold.  That also lead to dancing, which I am sure helped keep us warm.

We sent the couple off on their boat with sparklers.  Well, we were playing with sparklers when they got on their boat and left.  I believe that Tom liked his.

I called a couple of cabs, and we piled in.  The verdict for my cab was to go back to the hotel, the other one was going out for seconds.  I didn’t hear from them again till they called me at 4am telling me to come down and hang out.  I declined.

It was a good thing we headed back to the hotel, people were not feeling well.  Most of us just needed to lie down, some needed to spend some quality time curled up in the fetal position in a bathtub.

<img src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/blog/image/595/ryan_drive.jpg" align="right" />It was a good night, and everyone there had a good time.  The next morning was not so fun.  IHOP had a 45min wait, so we bailed not hat found some Einstein Bros. like place and ate a little breakfast before heading back to DC.  The ride back wasn’t nearly as fun as the one down.  Very little chatting and joking, a lot of sleeping and moaning, it sucks to have to be the driver.  I know Kelly offered, but I’s got more chivalry than that.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[She hasn't stayed home for more than one night for nearly two weeks.  I talked to her this morning and she sounded like she wanted to cry but was simply too tired.  Not one of those tired because she needs 8 hours of sleep kinds, more like she need 5 or 6 days of monotonous easiness to recover.

Last night for dinner I had cheese balls and chocolate chip cookies.  I blame Tom and Meredith equally. Tom gave me cheese balls and Mer made the cookies.

The wedding couldn't have gone better.  All the activities were a bit overwhelming, but in the end a good time.  I went to great adventure (rode the world's tallest and fastest [coaster](http://www.sixflags.com/parks/greatadventure/golden_kingdom/journal.html)), skipped on striper fishing, rehearsal dinner, played some late-night no-money poker, went bowling, was in the wedding, partied at the reception, reeked havoc at the hotel bar and went to Atlantic City (where we were too tired to gamble).

Traffic was good both ways, the only problems we had were driving around in NJ.  I do not like the directional dependency that NJ streets have--so many jersey walls (there they just call them walls) and jug handles.  If you see a store on the other side of the road you would like to visit, well too bad, wait for another.  'Cause it is not worth the 20 minutes it would take to get over there.

Happy things from this weekend:
<ul>
<li>Gerald came up.</li><li>Kelly and Helen getting along so well.</li><li>Not a drop of rain until all the pictures were taken.</li><li>Ay-jah-mah-jay!</li><li>5 people balling their eyes out at the head table during the toasts. </li><li>Danny's tricky dance (the song wasn't long enough).</li><li>Re-alphabetizing Helen's DVD collection.</li><li>Jeannie delivering her vows louder than dirk.</li><li>The U-F-Oh My God (AKA the Disk'O on the steel pier).</li><li>Mrs. McHugh smacking Danny's hung-over head.</li><li>Dirky-poo.</li><li>Jeannie's dress.</li><li>Calling Lance "Bubbles".*</li><li>NIN's Closer at the reception. </li><li>Wearing a tux to the brunch.</li><li>Videographer filming bowling shenanigans (specifically the wave with the cross bowling action)</li><li>4, count 'em 4 flower girls.</li>
</ul>

* Just in case I don't remember this is from trying to hand Lance the bubbles the flower girls handed me.  I was handing them to him and said "bubbles?" to which he responded "Are you calling me bubbles?"  Now that I think about it I guess I was. Lance is a cool guy.

Pictures to come.]]></content:encoded>

<title>Smells like China</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Li Ying Kui has gutted and remade my forms.  The rules for this year are so confusing, I am starting to think that no one is going to get things right.  The major changes have been with my chang quan form, since that is the only one with the new nandu requirements.  And even then, it is only A and B level movements, so we have special circumstances (like allowing the same nandu twice) due to the lack of C level.

I like most of the changes, but some things are just annoying.  He yanked my butterfly-butterfly twist-split.  It was my best trick.  Put in a bunch of XFJ’s and Jump front kicks instead.  I understand you gotta play the game to the rules, but we think the rules make for a silly looking form.

I must get twist-XFJ540-mabu.  This is my goal for the next month.  I hit it last night pretty solid, but was crazy inconsistent.  Rotation is not the problem, I can make it past the 540 by more than π/1.9, but hitting the landing is a totally different story.  Part of the problem is I lean on the landing like I would (should?) for a 360, so I want to fall back on the 540.  LYK even went as far as to say I should just do a 720.  Something about a little more rotation and the landing would be easy.  Ha!  Easy for him to say.

Training has been hard core recently. Unfortunately a lot of that is because of the heat.  O-Mei feel, smells and looks like china now.  No A/C, burning those mosquito coil smoke things, everyone very sweaty (read: B.O.), LYK's cigarettes, and the everlasting humidity and heat.   Who needs China.  No one speaks English there anymore.]]></content:encoded>

<title>The weekend of 6 events.</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I was exhausted last night. When we finally got home Kelly was heading in and I was unloading the car. She announced that Jennifer had been there, pointing out that she could tell because the dead bolt had been locked. After a second of fiddling with her keys Jennifer opened the door. We then simultaneously announced the painfully obvious fact that Jennifer was still there. She had finished her video and was trying to burn it to disk. So I helped her with that. TI was taking a long time, so she went home to check with the 'rents, and came back later. It was maybe 1/8 of the way finished so I told her to go home and come back in the morning. By this point I was struggling to stay awake, but fumbled through it and my hyper (caffeine induced) wife helped me verify that everything was working. So I got everything burned and exported to the camera. Jennifer just popped over before school at the horrible, horrible time of 6:40.

The 6 events.

Game Night

Well, there weren't any games so it was more of a welcome back party for Lord and Lady McPenberthy (of monopuss manor). Even though Kelly insists that it be septopuss, I like monopuss, with the emphasis on the 'no'. We got to see a bunch of wedding and honeymoon pictures on Danny's bright shiny new TV. I really want to go to the turkey cakes islands.

The Wedding

For Kelly's coworker. Congrats to Jamie and Michelle. A lot of alcohol related props (the favors, the place cards, the drinks), and a crazy group of people. It would have been more fun but I did just come from…

The Funeral

Toby Elmore didn't have a funeral, it was a goin' home party. The service resembled more of a praise service. Everything was beautiful and touching. Everyone was very supportive of Sommer and there was a feeling of sadness and hope. Much better situation than pure sadness. I wanted to tell Sommer more, like if she needed anything she could just ask, and that we were here for her and that God loves her and Toby is happy now; but all I got out was a rough "Hi…" and I couldn't even finish the syllable with out my voice cracking. So I gave her a big hug and let her get back to her family. I really just spent the rest of the day thinking about Sommer and Bailey.

Birthday brunch

The next day we started off on a much happier note, taking my Mom to brunch at the Jefferson hotel. While it was not cheap, it was totally worth it. Amazing food, and we had a great time chowing down.

Family Picnic

Picnic, pool party what have you. We stopped by the Wilson's house and decided that we needed to go out to grandma's to check out the new pool. Put on our trunks and headed out. The water was amazing, the backyard was great, and se had lots of fun splashing around. It was very nostalgic for me and Nikki to be swimming underwater with masks on--just like our old pool in cali.

Dinner for Coach

Hopped out of the pool, and right on to the freeway. We drove straight up to NoVA and went directly to the restaurant, arriving just in time for dinner. I thought it was going to be coach's sisters restaurant, but we went to Sweetwater instead. I was there when this was decided, but had promptly forgotten. Coach and Debbie got ribs and I had the joy of explaining that you are supposed to eat them with your fingers and this knife and fork thing was just silly.  Kelly had a couple of glasses of Tea to contribute to her aforementioned hyperness.

And for some reason I was a little sleepy that night.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I had a very strange dream last night.  It feels almost real, like a memory that happened a few yeas back.  But I don’t remember remembering it yesterday so I think it was a dream last night. Early in the dream we were talking about how the bats were out tonight, and they were everywhere.  During a course of events I am very fuzzy on I wound up in my car, at night, looking out the window.  I noticed a bat high up near the tops of the trees.  And in a very frightening disturbing and real way it swooped down and smacked into my driver side window.  It didn’t scare be and just sorta clung to the window screeching and carrying on.  I recall I tapping the glass to get its attention.  The strange thing was it was bout the size of a cat, a smaller one like Henry, and had a very cat like head.  The rest of much more bat like.

I think the strange thing is how vivid the memory/dream is.  Maybe this is telling me I should go see batman.

Training is going, some stuff I want to change back after Li Ying Kue modified my forms, mostly because I had the coordination to do the old movements and the new ones will take more practice time than I have before TT.  I am working my b-twist to XFJ540 and I am nearly there, I need to squeak out like 15 or 20 degrees of rotation to insure I don’t get deducted.  Same with my jump outside. I have been getting the rotation more consistently but it is still not up to the level I want.  Really sucks because the 18th of next month we have to submit out forms with the exact nandu we will be performing.  So I better get consistent at all these tricks ASAP or I am going to have to cut them.]]></content:encoded>

<title>They had more than 5 flags there</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[We had a very good demo at 6 flags.  One of the best demos we have done recently.  There was not a lot of prep or complicated choreography, instead we started with a few jump combos (jump front, tornado, aerial) to get everyone’s attention (we did attract a bigger crowd) and moved into sections.  Everyone did 2 sections of a form and we ended with Stephon and Jessica’s straight sword set (which was on FIRE!).  We had their DJ spinning for us instead of putting our cheesy techno song on repeat which helped our presentation incredibly.

6 flags was more ghetto than I remember.  Ghetto fabulous.  But less fabulous. Sad thing was when we left to go see batman it appeared that we brought all the 6 flags visitors along with us.  Because that was a G.F. crowd there.  It also had something to do with no AC in the theater--which turned out ok by me because we got free tickets to come back.  Sorry Neal, but we live closer.

Training harder.  Our time is limited, TT is quickly approaching, and this is makign my uneasy.  I have been getting more and more consistant on my bt-xfj540 so hopefully I will have that down in time to submit the forms. I am gonna miss spear class this week for a happy hour I need to attend, so hopefully I can sneak in some of the earlier training soon.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Serious planning on the basement has begun. Kelly and I are getting excited and went to start on the work, but at this point I am getting a bit nervous because I know once I start I will not want to finish until I am done.  That concerns me because team trials are about a month a way--39 days (!)--and I should really concentrate on that.  I was so close last time that I think I should really put my effort into trying to make this stupid team so that I can, oh I don't know, justify the last 5 years.

The fun part is we are going to relocate the bar.  The new location was mostly due to plumbing reasons, but I really think the new location will be a better one.  Reason #1: you will not see the bar when you walk in, it will be behind you to the left but the weights and the TV area will be ahead and to the right, thusly pulling you attention politely away.  This is good because I do not want a room in my house centered on drinking.  And the current bar--which slaps you in the face when you walk in (a good 70's mature film kinda slap)--is the most predominate and overwhelming feature to the basement now. Let’s not talk about how it lunges out at you.



I did a sweet little 3/4 iso drawing of the new bar, but the floor plan will have to do until I can scan it in.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Training went fairly well yesterday.  4pm sword, I did my new beginning -- which was stephon's new beginnign, but he didn't like it so he went back to his old one (effectivly making it his new new beginning) and I took his old new beginning.

  Coach also told me to drop about half the difficulty's from the form.  My current version has jump outside, tornado, butterfly-butterfly twist and aerial.  Nandu don't count for weapons this year so there is really no reason to tire my self out with any of the tricks, so I will drop about half.  She wants me to replace the b-btwist with an a-twist.  Ionno 'bout that.  It's good because she likes my aerial twist.  It's bad because that trick is scary enough with out having to worry about holding onto a freakin sword.

  I talked to coach for a while about putting in tile/wood on the entry way and for the upstairs waiting room.  She wants to install it this weekend but I think she is not going to be get the tile since she has no ordered it yet. She seems to think she can just go pick it up somewheres.  Perhaps she knows a place.

  7pm spear class.  Kelly even came to smack me around when I slack off.  I am starting to think my spear is going to be the stronger of the two weapons.  Perhaps it is just because I think my sword looks retarded at this point.

  After class I drilled my big important nandu and I was much more consistent this time.  A few little hops, a few under rotated, and a few were stuck.  So I am happy with that damn trick for now.

  4th of July plans.  Install the flag pole (well that might be 3rd of July plans), BBQ and go downtown to the mall.  Hopefully we can get some people to come hang out.  Maybe a little national mall frisbee or soccer.  It's grillin' time.]]></content:encoded>

<title>Backyard Barbeque, happy fireworks, and demolition.</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[According to Kelly, Happy Fireworks Day is second to Christmas, which is a tall order to fill when you do not have the marketing superpowers to back you up.  However I think we were able to make it a good enough weekend for her to come out happy.  I think the hours of that vicious cooking-cleaning-cooking cycle really helped keep her in the patriotic mood.  Something about the absurd prep time required for ribs or the homemade strawberry shortcake or even the exploded brat salad really hit it home for all those in the Sexton household.  Even those that don't live there all the time.

Everything started off with the wushu party on Friday night, after, well...wushu.  We went over to Sarah's house and caught up with Cheryl and a bunch of wushu peoples, O-Mei, USWA, even CMAI had people there. That was nice, it had a very non-political atmosphere going on.  Things were still clickish, but some people were able to transcend the school barriers and intermingle and that made me happy.  I was mostly sad that Lil Alex didn't hang a big longer (had to go crabbing), and that I didn't get to see Glenn too much.  He seems to have his own posse these days.  Oh, and his posse wears nice lactose shirts with a few popped collars.  Was a pretty fun party, playing poker with a the trendy Asians and the wushu nerds was surprisingly fun, and I even got invites for a 'real game' which I politely turned down.

Saturday was BBQ #1: Experimental ribs.  Kelly and I had tried ribs before in the oven.  Well, by "Kelly and I" I mean Kelly.  But the recipe wasn't really all that, and well, the ribs were cooked completely indoors.  This time was different, much more prep time, lots of cooking and basting and setting up and chilling and finally slapped on the grill outside and painted with homemade sauce. We had Stephon, Rong and Sarah over and they all agreed: the ribs were (on a scale from one to awesome) super great.  The sauce was some apple cidar/vinegar/brownsugar nectar and the meat was so nice and tender.  Kelly wins again. So much so that we went for the repeat with ribs on the 4th.

Sunday marked the start of demolition on the basement.  The Destruction at truxion.  Or, Kelly, Neal and Chris banging everything with a wrecking bar till it falls to the floor. We have to unfinish it if we want to refinish it.  Currently there is a bare naked I-beam  and a giant hole in the ceiling (thanks tom).  I am sure destruction will continue for a while since I am working it in-between so many wushu workouts.  But when you only have 4 weeks until TT you tend to neglect other things--no matter how much you want to finish this little basement project.

On the 4th I had an early training session at O-Mei with Sarah and Stephon (coach actually came to this one).  We had our CQ forms pruned and trimmed down for time.  She worked with us intently for some time, and I think I got some good out of it.  So much so that I may have to skip the early training today so that I can let my body rest.  My legs are week right now, my left calf is a little hurty (maybe from jump front-sit stance, maybe fatigue) and the right leg is just tired.  I tried to do weighted pistols (with the light kettle) and the left was fine, but I struggled with the right.  You know the jumping leg for all the wushu jumps.  Right, right, back on track.

After the training we were having the official 4th of July Barbeque.  I was able to drag Stephon and Sarah once they heard of the ribs repeat.  We also had Neal (left over form the destruction at Truxion the night before), Chris W, Danny, Sean, Nina, and eventually Cheryl and her basement buddy mike. We all ate till we were overstuffed.  Then we had a pull-up contest.  Neal got runner up with 10 chins.  I rocked the 15 but probably should of stopped earlier due to too many meat units in the belly.

The drive downtown wasn't too bad, we took 395 and were tricked by 12th street and it's little tunnel under the mall thing but eventually found a legit spot that the truck could fit into and made our way to wait in line for security.  I took a chance and went into the natural history museum to see if I could make to though to the mall and sure enough, I could.  So everyone tried to follow but the mean security man would not let us in with our picnic food.  So Sean and I went back to the big line and made the big wait.  Kelly and Neal found a spot and found some friends.  Later on we moved down to get a better Fireworks watching spot but that kinda put a damper on the kicking of soccer balls.  Great spot too.  Oh, never try to give Sarah directions.  We were on the <i>national mall</i>, you couldn't ask for more landmarks, but she was creative in the interpretation of the meaning of things like Washington monument, the mall, the American history museum.  She did prefer to use porta-potties as a reference, that and volleyball players.

Most impressive was the drive home, including a stop for to drop off the fellas in Ballston (and to make sissy) only took an hour and a half.  Go team hip replacement!

And in closing: [Crap Ninjas!](http://www.beaverandsteve.com/index.php?comic=10)]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I know Tom is going to be disappointed, but I am just getting new silks and not making a costume for a new Robin Hood play.

We get to make the new style of silks and have the option of designing my own, and well, I prefer to have original silks.

Consider for a moment those people who wander into a tattoo parlor and pick a tattoo design from one of the designs on the wall.  How thoughtless and trite it seems.  Well, silks are for running around on the carpet, and nowhere near as permanent -- or even as meaningful as a statement of my beliefs.  Nevertheless, I would like to have something not so cookie cutter.

Here is my design:
<img src="http://www.fuzzymonk.com/albums/wushurelated/newsilksGoldNavy.thumb.gif">
Gold and Navy
<img src="http://www.fuzzymonk.com/albums/wushurelated/newsilksGreyBurgundy.thumb.gif">
Grey and Burgundy

I think I am going gold and navy because the burgundy silk tends to be real purple when they dye it. I did not think of sub-zero until someone pointed it out to me. Arg.]]></content:encoded>

<title>Step 1: destroy -- done. What&#039;s step two?</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I just ordered my projector.  Yay!  The lady said it should be here in a few days.  Here’s the hoping it doesn’t come until we get back form Richmond.

The destruction is nearly complete.  There is really not much to do until we buy drywall and are ready to start hanging it.  I think before I do that I should get my projector and the lights we want to install so that I can wire everything up BEFORE we put up the ceiling.

I figure the ceiling should go up before the walls, and we can’t tear down walls between the main room and the utility room until we are ready to hang the walls for that (b/c the cats).  We may not get around to doing that until after TT.  Out of town this weekend, then I only have 2 more weekends to get ready.  Feel the pressure.

I have been feeling good.  An occasional acute injury, in other words, no pain from overtraining.  My shins have been feeling good, my hamstrings lack that normal hurty feeling they have.  I think my body has adjusted to all the hard training and able to keep up with silly wushu demands.  I remember feeling good before 2003’s TT, and that my shins didn’t hurt.  This is all good except I can’t stop thinking about one thing:  How do I remain pain free after TT?  I mean I am not going to be willing to devote as much time to training as I have been afterwards, so I won’t be getting the same conditioning, so I figure I will go back to where I was.  No, really, this is a legitimate concern of mine.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[The destruction is now complete.  Well, I think there is one piece of wood paneling left in the basement--the one around the breaker box--but that is hardly held up at all.  Neal, Jonathan, Kelly and I finished the wall removal.  Now that we have the studs and the utility room in view is feels much more unfinished down there.  We also have a stack of 23 sheets of drywall and a new (to us) leather couch. I would like to do something to get some of the stuff out of there to make the work easier, but at this point, we may just be moving it around as we go.  I hung the recessed lighting, and I am a little nervous about the placement, since it is easy to move them now, but a serious pain later if we change our minds.  I also need to come up with a good solution for wiring the projector.  Again, it is easy to run the wires but I am going to need a solution that would allow me to run more later.  Right now, I am thinking of trying to rig something with the C-channel conduit I saw at home depot.  Think server room.  Just mount it on the ceiling next to the I beam, which would sort of hide it and I could leave a gap allowing me to get into the ceiling above to run the cables to the projector.

All the electoral stuff makes my head hurt.  Too many options.  I really should wire for speakers and Ethernet while I am at it.

I nearly skipped wushu on Sunday.  With Dmitry, Josh and D's big ol truck helping me get drywall home; and Tom and Meredith giving us their couch I really wanted to continue playing with my projects and enjoy the weather we were having.  Eventually I did go and walk through some things, but not serious training.

I am feeling better about my forms, and I am at a point that I can concentrate on speed and flavor.

Saturday started with some early wushu, including training with Zach.  Afterwards we hit up the diner for some tasty breakfast and dropped Jonathan back at O-Mei and headed home for the pre-baseball BBQ.  We met up with the Tullos clan  at the Nationals game with most of the Andersons in tow. Well, all the Andersons named Anderson. It was a fun and we had a wonderful time mocking the blue shirts.  Giant hotdogs and a very warm metro ride just added that extra bit to the evening.  Thank God we didn't opt for the day game.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA["Chris, you remind me of a cartoon" - Kat
"Yeah, Chris is a cartoon!" - Jessica

"I love you for your goofiness" - Kelly

Those might be paraphrased a little, but couple that with the fact that everyone who knows me and has seen <i>Malcolm in the Middle</i> thinks that Dewy is a young me and you have the makings of a serious complex.

In other news I got rear ended the other day.  Middle of the day, I was on the way to our client site and suddenly I notice my head is slamming into the head rest.  I got out of the truck and saw this little Mercedes with her hood bent up and grill bashed in.  The lady didn't know what to do, and even said something along the lines of "should we exchange information or something".  Should we? Ya think?  I prolly could of gotten her information with out giving mine.   But I did.  I even had us pull off into a turn lane so we didn’t block traffic.  The truck, however escaped from the incident unscathed.  Yay for Chester!  I took him in for the 40K Mile service and had the dealer check him out they didn’t see anything wrong either.

On a side note:  Thank you Toyota for your head rest.

8 days. I don’t feel ready.  My wushu sucks.  I think I will just stay home and tinker with the basement.  Who came up with this sport anyway?

Talking to myself: Nandu are solid. Just relax and go fast.  Aw crap, I am getting butterflies now.]]></content:encoded>

So much invested in this thing and it just doesn't feel real. I cringe at the idea of how this is going to get twisted and turned into a political issue, but I am going vietnam either way.  So tired.  And hungry.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Good job everybody, and thank you Kelly.

It is weird hearing everyone congradulating me, and it defnitaly hasn't sunk in.  But the past two years havce been all for this one thing and I got it, so you know that feels good.  Hearing some of the parents remambering how I went back to training the day after TT03 and saying how all the hard work paid off was really something.

O-Mei really worked their asses off and is showed.  Jump training all winter, choragraphy finized in december and january, Li Ying Kue coming back out to rechoreograph our forms into what the judges would want.  Good job guys.

I am at a loss for for words.  So I put a few pictures up in the gallery.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Tom has invited me to go do stuff multiple times this week.  But every time he extends his generous invitation I have declined citing some sort of wushu related excuse.  I must say he is very justified in his complaints about too much wushu.  It is true before TT I fully expected a week or two of little to no ninja dancing.  Unfortunately I didn't expect a couple of things.  One, to make the A team and have to get ready for the Vietnam in 4 short, short months.  And two, a demo coach popped on us at the last min--Ode to Peace, with important Chinese people in the audience that we needed to impress.   Well, that coach wanted to impress.  Oh, and I have to get ready for Vietnam!  I really want some wings though.

I am going to work on the basement this weekend.  Hopefully tonight I can rewire one of the lights and be done with the wires, and then we can clean up and rearrange what ever we can so we are ready for renting the drywall lift for this Sunday.  Once the lift shows up I hope we can tack everything up nice and quick.  Sooner I get drywall on the ceiling the sooner it is going to be on the walls and the sooner I can use my projector!  Among the projects I need to accomplish are building the shelves into the wall of the utility room for the AV equipment, and some DVD shelves next to that.  Which will be a fun project, but I am thinking it may get complicated.   Got to figure out carpet.  And what to do about that gas line.  And throw a cat.  And figure out the air duct situation.  And the I-Beam.  And the speaker wire. And the speakers. And the stripper pole.  And patch the couch.  And more stuff too...

Yay, I even get to pay a mortgage!

Nearly forgot, I have to go to vietnam in 4 months, with these jokers:

<content:encoded><![CDATA[We had been at Sarah and Cheryl's little back to school BBQ and decided to head back to our place to chill in a little more intimate environment.  So we stopped off at Giant to pick up a few refreshments.  WE gathered our froofy drinks and snacks and took them up to the checkout.  Register 7, in fact.  As we were unloading our cart we heard this booming "Oh my God, it's Chris Sexton."  It was the cashier.  I looked at him, assuming he was someone from the School that I didn’t immediately recognize.  No, couldn’t place him.  Nothing.  He mumbled something about wushu and finished checking out the guy in front of us.  Andrew, according to his name tag, said he studies Taiji and that his sifu knows our coach.  Told me congratulations for making the team.  He asked for an autograph and told me how excited he was.  I must say I thought it was awkward and strange to have someone want me to wrote my name down.  He says that I made his night, but...nay, Andrew, nay—you have made mine.

Kelly and Neal were equally impressed at my first sighting.  As a result we sent Stephon there and told him he had to buy a pack of gum at register 7.  How great is that?]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I skipped wushu on Friday so that I could go to dinner with Jeannie and Dirk.  Their time here is limited, so I think that was fair.  Saturday I was going to Richmond under the assumption that I just needed to pick out tuxes with Everett and he really wanted to show me his place, including his disturbingly named man room.  Well, something was afoot and I was none-the-wiser.  We were supposed to meet Kelly and the ‘rents for dinner at the Extra Billy's.  So we roll in and I head into the restaurant and notice my parents in the little side room.  Funy thing was is my Mom was talking to Master Phuong.  Strange that he happened to be in the best barbeque joint in Richmond the same time we were going.  Weird.  Even weirder when I walked in and noticed the Tulli sitting at the same table with Dianne from Koryo.  And Katy-Jo and Summer.  It really didn't occur to me that it was a highly orchestrated party in my honor until they all yelled 'surprise!'

Man it was great, so many people.  Many of whom I hadn’t seen in a LONG time.  It was also great because we got to eat barbeque until we exploded.  I hovered from table to table chatting with everybody.  I sorta dissed my family (wife and in-fam included) because I hadn’t been able to talk to most of the others in such a long time.  It was especially fun to talk with Phuong and Dianne.  Dianne was pushing to get me to commit to coming to Koryo and giving a demo.  Which actually sounds like a bunch of fun, and I have begun brainstorming for how I can track some of the other O-Mei peeps to come down with me.  Nice to see how well Katy and Summer are doing.  Bailey was great, I loved watching her try and eat lemons.  I am thinking we need to set her and Joshua up in oh, 15 years or so.

My wife is awesome.

New goal on the basement.  We need to be projecting by the first Tech football game on 9/4. That gives me 18 days. We can do this.  I may skip wushu tonight so that I can continue construction.

We are currently faced with 2 decisions: What color to paint the basement and should be go ahead with the bar.

Paint color matters because of the projector, it is a big bright lamp and light/bright walls will reflect on the screen and hurt the contrast.  I am not going to go nuts and paint the room black, but I would like to stay away from florescent orange.  Despite how much I like florescent orange. The bar is simply a matter of money.  I got a new low quote from the Chinese guy, but even with that I think it could cost over a grand to get installed.  I am not sure that is where I want to put my money right now. I sorta think that money should go towards airfare this December.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I made the media shelf.  Beej scared me when he asked 'is it wide enough,' but I am pretty sure it is.  I measured my old TV stand for dimentions and it measured 19", so I made the opening 20", but then decided that I wanted drywall on the inside of the opening so I am back down to 19", more like 18 1/2" counting the spackle.  Make me a little nervious, but I went and measured a my reciever and DVD player and they all seemed to be a nice polite 17" or 18".  Knock on wood.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I had an interview at the big super cool consultants on Tuesday. By super cool, I mean they think they are super cool.  It was very interesting.  They had a room with 18 or so tables set up and the just invited a bunch of job hunters to come and look around.  The also promised free food, so I figured if anything I would get some free food out of it.  I threw on a pair of dark brown kakis (can the sill be kaki if they are brown?) and my spiffy new blazer.  A nice little brown on brown ensemble.  The reason I bring this up is they are a consultant firm that creates a consultant first and they work hard and play hard and all that—so it is black and grey suits for all.  Men and women.  I was subtly sticking it to the man with my dressing down.  I think this made a difference.

Of course the difference is prolly all in my head, and they saw I had on a 3 button jacket and didn't think twice.

The interesting thing about this situation is that at first I didn't know what to do or which tables I should go to.  I flipped through the booklet that described all the different projects, and they were full of empty words like leverage and synergy. A bunch of business jargon spew.  I sat at table one and they seemed to like me, they even made my final list (more on this later).  I got up and was standing in the middle of the chaos trying to read my who does what book, and was approached by table 16 who wanted to know why no one was going to their table.  I told them they didn't have any pretty pictures in the description.  They guy asked what I did.  "Software developer."  "Oh, come on over!" Sat and talked for a little while, everything seemed to be going well.  Not very interested in the work.  The guy mentioned Trim, I said I worked with it at DARPA.  They all flipped out, and immediately needed to go to a breakout room and interview me twice.  Still don't know why.  But they were sure excited.  Bunch of giddy ex-military guys.  Then I had the most bizarre conversation with this crazy software architect guy.  Hitting my with UML questions I had no idea about.  I kept muttering "I'm lower level than that.'  He promptly left at the end of a question. Awkward.

After that interview things picked up, I walked out of the breakout room and was approached by a recruiter who wanted me to go to their table.  I did.  Went well.  I got up to go wander some and was approached by another HR guy, but his table person wasn’t there, so I went to the bathroom.  On the way back to the table I had been requested for I was approached again, but said I needed to go talk to the first one first.  I wound up talking for a long time to the last two, the event was closing and everyone was going home but a couple people stayed behind to talk.  It was good to feel wanted.  Fun stuff.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last weekend we (Kelly, Neal, Paw Tullos and I) went nuts working on the basement.  This weekend was much more fun than last.  We did a lot of work both weekends only this time we were able to see progress. I do not like mudding and sanding repeatedly, with all the dust and neck wrenching and sanding with the monster only to finish up and notice that, yep, still got unfinished walls.   This weekend was different.  When we were done we noticed a big change.  A lot of work is OK if there are good results to show for it.

We accomplished enough that we were able to set up the equipment and get the projector up and running.  Which resulted in inviting people over and christen the basement with a football game.  Hokies did it in the end, but it was a close game but we squeaked NC State for the win.

<img src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/destruction_at_truxion/image/595/IMG_1026.jpg"  class="picture">

The work continues,
<img src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/destruction_at_truxion/image/595/IMG_1025.jpg" align="right" border="0">we still have some painting.  There are some places that really could use some more mudding, but I may just pretend to not notice them.  I have been tinkering with the AV stuff, getting the computer working on the projector was not so trivial.
I got it up and working for less than the price of the DVI cable.  I just needed a new video card and the VGA cable.  Done deal. Tonight we paint!

Oh, I did go to wushu.  My hip/adductor is still bugging me.  Doing jump outside kicks with the right leg make my left hip hurt.  Holding in my left leg against the centripetal force can really aggravate it good.  Plus, my hammies are sore from not training hard for a couple weeks.  I really just need to take it easy for a wile, but we got a demo and worlds coming up quick.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[is 8,006,008,977.

I love the direct line to the costumer retention department.  I called and chatted with Aaron for a wile, we talked aobut football, scifi, nascar, college and computers for a wile and he hooked me up with a sweet deal. I understand that I prolly could have gotten some more out of him, but I figure the $299 (minus the $100 rebate) for the HR10-250 was a good deal.  Beej was happy with his $699 and a $200 credit at directv.  When I told him about my deal he didn't beleave me.

beej: 299 HD Tivo?
me: correct
beej: i cant believe it

<img src="http://www.directv.com/images/imagine/hddvr/header.gif">

All said and done it is $199 (+tax, stupid the man).  Bully!]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[This might be my last day in Fairfax. Weird. Strange.

I don't know what I think about this.  I am getting a little nervous about the new gig.  Not nervous in a bad way, more like the nervous excitement of going off to school. But to a much lesser extent.  I am a little worried about the commuting situation.  I don't know how good or bad it will be.  Parking at the metro?  What time does the lot fill up?  Can I just build a helicopter?  How about a scooter?  Does Tom want a pizza party or should we go fancy like red robin?

Kelly and I went to the Neighborhood board meeting last night, to make sure we voiced our opinions on the new parking policy (our opinion: no thanks).  The politics there were a bit silly, I understand it was a bit enhanced because of the new elections but watching people antagonize each other was a bit crazy.  There were a couple of people that would insist on talking in a loud and demanding manner that would only repeat the obvious or attempt to impart some vague pointless wisdom, I am not sure why, but I think it is because they are smarter and better than the board/other people there. I think there needs to be some B.S. monitor there that will politely point out when people are being so transparent and unhelpful.  I don't think I will be going back to these meetings until they are going to be doing something for real about the parking.

My hip is better after getting Charlie to look at it.  I don't know how much better since I am going easy because I am worried about aggravating it.  Charlie says it is a ligament and I should just restrict my movements on that side.  He gave me some Chinese medicine patches and said they should cut the recovery time in half.  So, being the good china man I am I slap that stinky patch on it at night.

Currently wushu is all two man set for me.  I just need to get the choreography down with Stephon.  I think if we get this thing down, we are going to have a good shot with it in Vietnam.  It could be our best event, easy.  We need to get it functional by October 2nd for our big demo at the Kennedy Center.   C'mon hip!

Blacksburg this weekend.  Not real good timing, I get my HD Tivo on Friday and then we gots to jump in the car and get out of there.  That is just mean.  But Souvlaki's and Sharky's and Hokie house are so, so nice.  I can't wait to go be on campus again.  Ross Gore was a smart man, screw this working world, go back to school 6 more years.  He might be short, but you gotta admit that was a smart move.

<img src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/destruction_at_truxion/image/595/IMG_1048.jpg" border="0" align="right">Basement progress: Phase 1 complete.  Need baseboards and cabinets for the bar. I am thinking about working on that during my down time between jobs.  Maybe.  If we can afford it.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[It has been awhile, and I haven’t posted because I have been super busy.  Since I have been busy a lot of (fun) things have happened.  With my continued busyness I don’t thin I will be able to assert the required effort to describe them.  Perhaps I can revisit them soon, but until then here is the high level overview.  Tivo style.

Badoop-badoop-badoop...

Went to Radford to see my lil’ist sister.  The excuse for the trip was the Football game. Ohio was shut out 45-0.  We took Jessica along.  She didn’t have any VT apparel.  Shameful.

Badoop-badoop-badoop...

I officially left my company.  I also officially got sick from drinking.  I blame Tom and to a lesser extent Ben.  Oh, and Ryan, Riya and Dave too.  Not Kelly.  Never blame Kelly if you want her to take care of you.  Kelly took care of me.

Badoop-badoop...

I trained Saturday with little pain, but it was a light workout as the kids had demo practice so it was just me and Jason with a few beginners.  After training I promptly ran to Springfield mall to try and find Kelly a present.  I wanted to get a nice silver bracelet.  That was harder than I thought.  I wound up picking up a gold hearts one.

Badoop-badoop...

We spent some fun time with the Tulli, had a little BBQ and celebrated Kelly and her dad’s birthdays.  We got him XM, and instead of paying best buy install it for us I opted to pocket the $40 and plug the thing into the cigarette lighter my self.  Seriously, that and run the antenna was the entire install. $40, my…

I also jammed my right middle finger something awful.  After we were done playing catch. We were walking in and Neal tossed the football to me and *crack* time for ice.  That has made sword especially difficult.

Badoop...

Kelly’s official birthday was Monday.  So I had to do something fun.  She had a left over gift certificate for the Ritz which we cashed in for Sunday night.  Even ate a wonderful dinner at Cheesecake factory.  Well, over ate.

Most of Monday was spent downtown at the national archives.  I saw the constitution.

Gong!

SONOFABITCH! Someone hacked my website and busted up phpBB, so some thing may be down for a bit.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[New workin' is keepin' me busy.  I am still stuck at that point where I don't know how they do stuff enough to really go and do stuff.  So much to learn.  I go though lines and lines of code trying to figure some stuff out and I just wind up with a headache - too may things to keep track of all at once.

Wushu is going again.  I am trying to be cautious about getting back into things because of the hip.  Friday I was feeling great so I went ahead and pushed a little.  I wasn't trying to stick my landings down in the full proper stances, but I was throwing the nandu.  First Aerial Twists since TT, and they felt easy.  XFJ's felt a little sluggish, but the twists (both A's and B's) felt fine.  Everything was great until after class when I noticed the hip was a little sore.  Not too bad and by the end of Saturday (no training - watched a football game) I was feeling a little better.

Jammed finger is definitely better, unlike Jason's (who claims his hasn't improved at all).  I still cannot slap, so it makes some things awkward.  Like wheeling arms and slap kicks (go figure).  I cannot wait for it to be 100% again.  Just for jump fronts again.

Nikki stopped by this weekend before going off to the craziness that is the Demarco's so we got to show her the basement.  She was thoroughly impressed and went on how much Anthony would like it.   That made me happy.  We hung out and Neal even came over for some added fun.  I helped him with his PC woes and we hit that thing with a stick.  Eventually everything got backed up and working.

Monday was a nice present from my new employer as they decided (2 days before the weekend) that we shouldn't work.  So we didn't.  Instead I slept in, went to lunch with the wife and headed over to Sean's place to deal with his computer problems.  You sell a guy on how awesome linux is, but then if the flash plug-in audio cannot stay in sync when they watch Homestar then you are gonna promptly loose your convert.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I am feeling very uninspired recently, but I figure if Everett's wedding doesn't constitute a post then nothing does.  So, in lieu of never writing again I figure I will make a quick post.

I had to leave work early so that I could jump on the metro and meet Kelly back at Merrifield so we could speed off to Richmond.  By way of nasty traffic.  It. took something like 4 hours.  Who ever thought a Fredericksburg should go there was not a very smart guy at all.

So the trip where we got to go hang out at my parent's house before the rehearsal turned into the trip where we went directly to the rehearsal.  Thank God I printed directions from that side of town.  Rehearsal went well enough, the wedding coordinator didn't really seem to know what she was doing. I figure if I know the answers to the questions she was being asked better than she does, well, she doesn't know too much about weddings.  Men sand with hands at their sides, not together in front of the crotch. Aiya.

Dinner was nice, Kelly and I had big kickass filets.

I tried to make Everett go do something fun on his last night, but he was a bit more interested in pseudo-moping around.  So I gave him his present early.  The U-Chair for his Man Room.  Told him how it made a nice guitar playing chair.  He seemed to really like it.  Whew.  Try as I might, he would not go out.  No bars. No stripper. No burritos.  Nothing.

Ev woke up early and realized his phone was in the car that his woman took, so he walked to a pay phone to demand I come and get him NOW (about 9).  I snoozed a bit and arrived over at his place at the planned 10.  We got some breakfast at IHOP and found that Everett's anxiety was largely hunger based.  So with a less nervous Everett we headed off to the church for a little picture taking fun.

Nothing too exciting.  I helped a few people with their tuxes.  We took pictures.  Ate a little bit of finger food.  Got Everett married.  Decorated his car (in a tasteful manner) and sent him off.

I was a little miffed that the reception was so abbreviated.  There were no toasts, which was a little frustrating since I had been working on one.  He was real ancy to get out of there, changing out of his tux early (he wore brown shoes for the cake cutting 'cause his feet are too delicate).  He just jumped in the car and took off.  It's like he had more important stuff to do.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[OK, I have been busy da bee.

Searching everywhere for airline tickets to Vietnam.  Prices vary so much from day to day, from company to company (same airlines).

Called firewood Jim a bunch, and finally set up a time to come over and pickup the wood.  It took me an hour to load it up into Chester.  And that was when he was no more than 5 feet away from the pile.  Unloading it is going to be annoying.  Right now it is sitting in the back of the truck with a tarp over it.

Kelly found a stove she wanted to look at in Sears.  We went over there.  I found a nice open box Kenmore Elite (+ convection) that was marked down nearly $600.  We bought that, threw it in the back of the truck and hauled it home.  That thing was heavy x 2, so tricked Tom into coming over and helping.  Good thing too or it would be sitting in the back of the truck with a bunch of wood and a tarp.

Kelly was kind enough to go to home depot and talk to the appliance people to get me some Teflon tape and a flexible connector for the stove while i was picking up the firewood.

I never said this was gong to be chronological.

<img src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/blog/image/595/Stove.jpg" align="right" border="1" />I installed the stove and everything appears to be working now.  No leaks.  No bubbles with soapy water.  No smell. It makes fire real nice. Everyone say a quick prayer for me, just in case.  Please.

...

Thanks!

Hokies played a great game and we squished BC politely.  Bring on Miami!  We even watched with one of Kelly’s work friends, Lori, who went to BC.  Everything was nice and polite.  Both team, even.  This was not like UMD.  No. Neal, your school makes our school not nice.

Wushu needs to be stepped up but every time I try that my hip gets worse.  It has been slowly getting better but once it does I push it and I am on the Groin train.  With stops at My-Hip-Hurts Junction and Xuanfengjiao-to-Mabu-Hurts-Me Station.

Lots of work to do at work town today. So I am off.  Wish us luck as we must book our tickets today.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[WARNING this post is needs revision, at this point it is more stream of thought than anything, so don't read it if you want things like sentences that make sense.

I know I haven't been writing like I used to, but things have been a little crazier than normal during my writing time.  And by 'writing time' I mean at work.  For the next couple weeks things are going to be (in the words of my boss) "balls to the wall" until we deliver what we need to on 12/1.

With that said, the work at the new company is fun.  I am in your standard learn new stuff as fast as you can while trying to crank out what is needed.  There seems that there is always going to be some sorta tangent to go off on-all the wile doing work-but not always what is prioritized.  They make their proprieties very clear, but is it the other stuff that qualifies for either fun or impressive.  And I am still having fun so I would really like to impress them.

I was thinking the biggest drawback to the new gig was the commute, and while at nearly an hour each way it is annoying, but half that time is on the train.  Since I am typing this on the metro now, I don't really feel that the time sitting on a train is really a waste.  I like having the 30 minutes to relax, think through my day, listen to music, skim the paper and get ready to get to work.  This is exactly what Dirk called.  Like he said I can get to work and hit the ground running.   Remember the only other time I had to cross state lines to get to work was at IMAKE, so my point of reference was the fair oaks/Bethesda commute.  And that was Beef.  Stew.

I have been sick for about a week now, some sort of bronchitis-like thing.  Lots of nasty green flem and coughing.  I woke up feeling much better today than I had for this past week, but I am going to go to my doctor today anyway.  I figure the only reason I woke up feeling better was because I made an appointment.  Plus I am going to try and milk as much out of this as I can.  I am going to get them to look at the cyst on my writs as well as see if I can get any of my required Vietnam shots early.  I would like to split up the shot is possible, just so I don't have a bunch of them all at once.  While I am there I really should see if I can get the EEG order for the hospital that the IWuF need.

I just need to get healthy so that I can start getting ready for this WWC.  I am considering it a bad thing that my hip hurts when I cough.  Honestly I think it has moved, it was a weird hip/abdominal pain a few weeks ago, but recently it feels more like a regular groin injury now.  I am wondering if my body was compensating for the bad muscles or if I just went and hurt it on my own.

Speaking of wushu, I got to hang with James again.  It had been something like 3 years.  I was really glad to see him, and when I heard he was coming here with the Beijing wushu team tour I was homing we could get together.  It seems he is doing well, and it was fun to catch up.  We were even able to bond over our fun ZGF and CP stories.  Trust me when I tell you, they were able to do to him in 4 days what took 2 years for me.   It know it is bad, but deep down it was oddly satisfying when other people come to the same conclusion.

James is running this Beijing wushu team tour full time now, and he is looking to work full time for wushu.  Not gonna coach, but wants to do some other work, he's not really certain what or how, but something along the lines of promoting the sport in the bay aera.  These work aspirations led us to a very interesting conversation about wushu and money.  Since he is in volved in GetWushu we talked about that, and how it basically cateres to the elite wushu player, and that means there is very little money.  Mostly because anyone at that level already goes to china and gets stuff there, or buys it from their coach.  So Get Wushu is stuck supplying a few collegiate clubs and that's about it.  Either way this seems very interesting to me provoking a fair amount of thought.  Hmmmmmm.....]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Submitted my (and stephon's and coach's) applications for our Vietnamese Visas today. It is pretty stinking confienant that I can walk to the embassy to drop that sorta thing off.  Of course it was a frikkin long walk.  According to google maps, it is only 1.5 miles, but it seemed longer.  And as a bonus it didn't get cold and rainy until after I made that little trek.  We are supposed to get them back next friday (the 25th), then we gotta beat feet over to the China Visa office to get that one, because we leave the 6th.  A little last minute excitement.

Stephon and I really need to train the hell out of our duilian.  I am almost of the openion that we should do nothing but train that set until worlds -- it is our best chance at a good placement, and we havn't been doing it nearly long enough.

On a side note I am finally getting pumped about this whole worlds thing.  Of course the side trip to china really helps.

Ack, gotta run, I need to cover for stephan tonight because he is doing the fund raiser at the silver diner.  Lets hope he rakes in the money (Note: That fool keeps trying to split it for the entire team, but we wont let him).]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I got my physical today, and am still waiting for my blood work back, but other than that I had a clean bill of health.  So that was fun.  Hopefully the little doctor’s note my doctor gave me will count as a “health certificate” for Vietnam.

I was also proud of myself for not getting all queasy when I had my blood taken.  A week ago when they did the blood work I felt fine after the taking part, but then sitting there waiting for the next three shots I felt my blood pressure drop and got light headed.  It is frustrating, because intellectually it doesn’t bother me at all.  The thought of needles is not something that really bothers me, acupuncture is all fine an dandy.  But you draw blood or give me a few shots and…blamo, I can’t see.

But everything is done, EKG was good, my blood pressure was a tad low, but perfectly normal.  My doctor suggested that I get life insurance now since they have nothing to argue over.

Saturday was a super fun football day.  I didn’t get to watch everything, but all was in favor of the Hokies.  We stomped the Wahoos, and Miami lost to Gatech.  What could be better?  Maybe if Fresno St coulda hung on a little longer.  But I will take what we got.  Watch out FSU! Return of the Hokies (Lucas: because Hokies don’t take revenge).

Saturday also had a lot of drywall fun at Tom’s place.  I felt all cool for my drywall know-how.  Even though drywall is pretty easy, I made all the classic mistakes on the basement so Tom’s little patch work was easy.   I am glad I didn’t have to deal with the spray on popcorn stuff.

We didn’t get to see Harry potter, much to Kelly’s dismay.  It was sold out till real late.  So maybe sometime this week.

This week is pretty much the last week of training.  Next week is the week before worlds, so it will be all mental prep and walking through forms.  Everything is ready, except for the duilian – so Stephon and I really need to train that hard.  We worked on it some on Sunday before the pre-thanksgiving, so I am feeling pretty good about it.

Pre-thanksgiving was awesome.  Riya’s house is awesome.  I ate too much.  Dave drank too much. It was just like a proper thanksgiving dinner.  Kelly didn’t do all the cooking, but she did a bunch of it, and was super happy when everyone said how great the food was.  It was all good, but I am going to go with my personal bias and say her stuff was outstanding.  Dave’s proclamation of “I have had a bunch of pecan pies, but this is the best ever” really made her day.  Eating pie really made my day.  It was great to hang with everyone again.  I hope we can do this every year.  In fact,  I say we do it again tonight!]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[7 days till I go and get on a plane. I would really like to go and get the plane ride out of the way now.  Then I can just go to Vietnam instantaneously when the time comes.  I am not looking forward to sitting in a coach seat, longing to go to sleep, with everyone asleep around me, not sleeping.  For lots of hours.

I got our Visas from the Vietnamese yesterday, and Coach is supposed to take the passports to the Chinese today.  So all our papers should be in order shortly, with a few days to spare.  How ever un-Chinese of us.

Speaking of being Chinese.  The federation didn't submit our hotel reservations for us in Hanoi by their deadline.  Yes, I got it to the federation before our deadline, but they decided that not everyone had submitted so they would wait to send the money off.  So we don't get to stay in a 5 star hotel.  The downgraded us to a 3 star. Arg.  Very annoying.  But that wasn't too bad, until a later email where they threw in a "there are no meals included" comment.  Because they didn't bother to submit the forms they had on time to the Vietnamese federation on time we don't get food.

Oh, I also FedEx'd a box of jackets to Cung Le's school last night.  2 day express.  At a mere cost of a hundred bucks.  Again, more stuff you would think they would handle.

In happier news we hosted a thanksgiving.  Jacob and Joshua thought our house was a ton of fun, mostly because you could roughhouse in the basement.  There was lots of building forts our of foofs (which, honestly, doesn't work very well) and jumping on furniture and otherwise being crazy.

Nikki was being a dork, as she decided to play in the upstairs bathroom instead of having thanksgiving dinner with us.  Amy was MIA due to a legitimate and painful excuse. But everyone else was there, we all crammed around a couple of folding tables that I stole from O-Mei and went to town.  Food was awesome.

Jacob however decided he wanted to sit next to Neal at dinner -- effectively knocking me down a peg on the coolest uncle scale.

Note to self: take out Neal.

Ack, work.  BBL.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Plese pause the snow for a day.

I was up late packing last night. I don’t leave until tomorrow morning, but I felt the need to get as ready as I could last night.  Last time I went to china I was packed up well in advance, but this time I was procrastinating.  I went shopping yesterday to get a few more things for the trip.  But a few more things (+ a remote controlled mouse for the cats) wound up being over $200.  It was the lacrosse bag and under armor shirt that killed me.  Necessary evils, really.  Just like the sour candy for the flight.

At this point I am more nervous about the travel than the competition.  I think if I can get out of Newark on time (c’mon no snow) I should be fine.  I have a connection on Beijing to a different carrier, so we will see how that goes.  What I don’t know if continental is late getting me into Beijing will China Southern politely let us reschedule.  Well, worse comes to worse we get to play in Beijing for two weeks.  Heh, maybe then Stephan could train there like he wants.  No matter how many times you tell him 2 days is not enough time to train he still wants to try.  Poor guy, always training.

Oh, I got an email from Danh, who as quickly as he decided to go with us has changed his mind and backed out.  Damn, he was our free extra checked bag.  Not to mention our translator and expert in all things Vietnamese.  I guess this will just be a little more adventurous with out him.  And I am all about adventure.  With one stipulation, I like adventure when it doesn’t unexpectantly cost me a lot of extra money.

Hmm, the snow is now whipping around downtown DC.  It is good for watching the interesting wind patterns.  It is bad for on time flights tomorrow.  This could get us there late.  Which if you consider Jason’s situation is not so bad, since his is flying standby if stuff gets canceled all the later flights will be packed and he won’t get to go anywhere.

Must...get...out or North America...]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Maybe it’s Siberia.

The flight is running behind by about an hour, When they took us over to get deiced in Newark apparently someone tripped over the power cord and unplugged the plane.  So after 45 min of waiting to get it rebooted and another 15-20 or good ‘ole sitting time we got airborne.  This does not bode well for our connection in Beijing.  There are number of obstacles.  The father of them all is the time crunch, we no only have a hour.  I thought 2 hours was going to be pushing it, but now it is down to an hour.  Because we booked the tickets on separate reservations they don’t handle out checked bags for us.  I am not convinced they would handle them anyway, but I know for sure they won’t be helping us out on that side of things.  Then there is the issue of making it thought customs and getting checked in on the flight at China Southern.  If we don’t make it we may have to spend the night in Beijing.  Well, spend the 25 hours in Beijing.  You are allowed to stay in the china airport for up to 25 hours with out a visa.

This wouldn’t be so bad if I didn’t have the sinking feeling our single entry Visa may restrict us to the Airport.  If it doesn’t then we can go crash at Shaichahai, get some good food and do a little shopping.  Otherwise it is Ji bang gong in the terminal for me and Mr. Farm. Kelly knows our situation, and hopefully we can locate a phone in the airport that will allow us to give her a call.  I am also wondering if we wind up using out visa for tonight if we can get another one from the Chinese embassy in Hanoi.  If there is such a thing.

We talked to Zach before taking off in Newark, and his flight from Atlanta to Korea was redirected and last we heard they were in Paris.  At that point they didn’t have any sort of contingency plan and were just hoping to get a flight to Korea.  At least if they get stuck there for 24 hours they don’t need a visa to go outside.

So far the flight as been pretty good, I was able to sleep some. More than I have ever slept on a plane before.  Now I am suffering form the well, I slept and I am not very sleepy thing.  I know, if you know me, then you would know that I don’t normally have this problem.  Normally I can sleep for long stretches, wake up, mill around and zonk right back out. I do however have problems sleeping in these awful coach seats.  Thank the Good Lord that Stephon and I have an empty seat between us.  Not only does it prevent any incidental snuggling, but it is just more comfortable to spread out.  And in this case spreading out involves a belt buckle jabbing my in the buttocks and an armrest that won’t go all the bay back nuzzled into the back of my shoulder. Why can’t long flights have fully flat beds.  I could sleep the entire flight if that was the case.

Oh, about the Mr. Farm thing.  We med a small, apparently slightly spoiled Chinese boy, Alex.  He was sitting behind us on our flight from DC to Newark and Directly in front of us on the big one.  We spoke in Chinese, he threw pillows and head phones at us.  When he asked our names he got ‘Chris’ right away, well it was actually Mr. Chris when he said it, but ‘Stephon’ was a bit harder for him.  He preferred Mr. Farm or Mr. Fan depending on his mood.

Funny side note, we tried to miss this flight by sitting in the airport watching Wushu videos and Stephon looked up and there was no line at all.  We heard the last call announcement and ran over and walked right on.  Of course the plane didn’t push back for quite some time after that, so we woulda been fine, but we sure tried.

I really want to get to Hanoi tonight, but since I called china southern airlines and know it is nto going to cost us lots of money, well, I am up for an adventure. But no more than 24 hours of it, because we got a competition to deal with.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[We were unable to make our connection so Conetenental put us up in a hotel.  Nice place, the Sino-Swiss Hotel.  We get free dinner, breakfast and lunch--in that order. The concierge lady for the airline was great, she was helping us as soon as she could find us.  And the crazy thing is that she found us, we walked right by her when we were getting off the plane.  Once she knew were we needed to go she made sure that we were taken care of, unfortunately we were just too late.  If we had another 15 minutes we might have been able to make it.  So we sat around for  along time just outside of the border control booths.  During that time the concierge lady handed us off to another girl--Stephon described her as pretty.  I went with pretty ditzy; either way she was nice and made sure we going to be ok.

 We wound up with a temporary 2 day visa and were brought up to the continental offices to wait for the hotel representative to take us to the hotel.  There was lots of hand holding, which was a nice change for Beijing.

When we got the hotel we immediately went out and found and IP card and wondered around a bit.  We picked up a few drinks at a little store (Stephon said it looked like meat-packing place), I got a green tea one that sorta has a dish soap flavor.  I should have gone with the minuite maid like Stephon.

We came back to the hotel, tried to make a call with the IP card, but I was dialing the international number wrong so no luck. It was still early morning in DC, so we went to dinner and asked the people at the front desk how to call the US.  001!  Oh yea, I remember that.  Once that worked I got Kelly’s voice mail in 3 places.  Damn.  We also called Xiangbo so that he could tell Sifu that we were going to be late.  Hopefully that will get through and we will have a ride at the airport tomorrow.

About 11 pm I the phone in my room rang.  It was the wife!  Besides being really sleepy and not having a clue what was going on I was very happy to hear her.  I told her the name of the hotel and she was able to use her cookie to give me a call.  Well, only after she spoke with Stephon, but that is because we are in the wrong rooms.  I talked to her and she told me all the adventures she had in trying to figure out what our options were if we didn’t have the hand holding from Continental. Luckily we did and there was no need to do anything crazy.  Like apply for another visa in Hanoi.

Well, we are safe in Beijing, we have a bus to take us back to the airport at 2pm, it is currently 7, so I think we are gonna go wonder around, explore a little and just kill time in China. So it was definitely not all bad, there was no sleeping in the airport or nothing.  Just a fancy hotel and free meals--and I can talk to my wife!]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[So far worlds is nothing but crazy balled up, squished down and throw right in your face.

We got here and found out that we missed the first day of training, where the rest of the team was able to get in a few hours of good working out in.  For some, it was too good.  Phillip and Jason both hurt themselves on that day.  I believe they both did it on the new style carpet that was out.  Phil rolled his ankle really bad on an aerial and Jason tweaked his knee a little on the gui bu landing after a tornado. Both moves they can do in their sleep.  So the next day when Stephon and I actually were able to train with them we all were a little cautious.  The tricky thing was all the judges were sitting in the stands watching us, so we had to go for it enough to impress them, but not get hurt.

The organizing committee here is prolly the real source of the aforementioned crazy, we have a couple of liaisons that are supposed to go to bat for us, but on our experience they don't really step up to the plate.  For example, when we showed up for training they wanted us to use the warm-up rooms, the guard man wouldn't let us pass.  Our helper lady didn't question anything and just insisted that we go to the warm-up room-the guard said there was no training going on, it was just a meeting.    Luckily we had Jason walk past the stairs the guard was at and use the ramp to get up there, because there was plenty of training going on.  Eventually we all made it into the arena, but only after walking around the long, stinky way.

While we were at the arena we were able to see out events schedule and the order we will compete.  I had a fun sinking feeling when I saw my name on the top of the list for men's chang quan.  I was only reassured that this was worlds, its not like team trials where your order is inversely proportional to your score (oh, BTW, after watching competition this morning, all reassurances have been nullified).  We also found that Phil was down for the wrong events and Stephon and I were not on the list for dui lian.

We spoke to Lu Xiao Lin and she was able to get our names added to the dui lian list.  Apparently the IWuF had us registered and simply forgot us on that list.  Phil was not so lucky; according to the IWuF the USAWKF registered him for Staff and Broad Sword, not Straight Sword like he wanted.  This really sucks, mostly that he won't get to compete in the event he trained in, but because they instantly blamed sifu--even though she was fighting for them.  I just find it so frustrating that is the knee jerk reaction.

As frustrating as this Phil sword thing is (on top of a bad ankle) everything is going well, the team is cheering hard for each other, and we are all getting along.  One U.S. Team, here representing our country.  And I don't know about my teammates, but I think that representing is a pretty kick-ass thing.  Meeting all the players from all over the world, people from everywhere-Lebanon, South Africa, Turkey-lots of places you don't think of when you think wushu. Plus, being able to compete with the top athletes from places like Japan, China, and Macao is absolutely surreal.   I don't feel like I should be given this honor, I don't think I am going to embarrass my self, but this situation was a dream I worked hard for but never truly considered that I would make it.  After being crushed in 01 to miss that 12th spot by a hundredth, I justified it away.  Now I am in this crazy country of mopads and a very weird language that I cannot begin to understand and I am doing it.

It is all very real now. It is going to be way too real when I am walking onto that carpet first tomorrow.  Lets hope I can turn it on for another 1:20 then.

Ok, enough cheesy crap-o. Taxi's are boring and expensive(er).  Mopeds are cheaper and way more fun.  It is not as fast as it looks, and its true you are pressed up against a less than clean person, but it is silly fun.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Really really dirty.

I am taking pictures to show friends and family back home, but that is not going to convey it.  If I had scratch and sniff pictures with all smells then maybe they would get an idea of what is going on here.  Often stinky and dirty go together.

I compete again tomorrow.  I am pretty tired today, so I will need some good sleep tonight. I don't think I go on until the evening, so I can get up chear for Jason, take a nap, and head down for some jianshu. Stephon is first in our division, and I am 8th, so we will get it done and over with early.  Once that happens I need to concentrate on duilian so I don't make the stupid mistakes like we did during our day of training.

Oh, I talked to Steve Coleman, the changquan guy from Great Brittan, and yes we did tie--and we both got 15th place.  15th in the biggest event at here, upwards of 80 athletes in that thing.  Yes, this is bizarro Hanoi.

Time to go chear Zach on for daoshu.  (U-S-A JIA YOU!)]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Because the food here scares me.

I am one of four US Team members that has no had food poisoning. I spent the night and this morning with everything flying out both ends.  Nothing quite like being awoken with this urgent need to flush your bowels only to be interrupted mid flush with the immediate desire to empty out the top half of the GI tract.

Apparently the three sanshou athletes have it much worse than I do, or at least did.  Some of them tried to push through it at first, only to have things get worse.  I had Cipro with me so that morning after talking to the team doctor this morning.  The one sanshou girl, Sarah, came down with it the same time as I did, and was apparently hurting pretty bad, so I gave her one of my antibiotics to get her started before the doctor was able to get them some from the hospital.

I wasn't going to compete, I was hurting, and unable to keep food down.  We wound up talking to sifu, and to coach and they both said I should.  During the ridiculously long cab ride over to the stadium later during warm ups I was not happy.  I was more concerned with my exit strategy should I get sick mid form than actually doing my routine.  Luckily I was 8th, so I didn't have to wait too long to get it over with, and that is exactly what I wanted to do the entire time -- get it over with.

I hopped on my jump outside -- something I never do -- and bent my legs pretty bad during my aerial.  I just had no legs at all during the form, but was still able to squeak out a 8.96, so I am really happy.  Had I hit my jump outside I would have broken 9 again. I think that placed me in the top 20, unless I got bumped out at the last minute.

This phil dang saga continues to unfold, he decided that he was going to try to compete in sword even though the IWuF said he couldn't get added<!--, so he tried to go straight to the vietnamese registry helpers and get his name on the list.  I was a bit surprised that he decided to go behind coach's back, but it looks like he got a proper talking to because of it-->.  I feel really bad if it is a clerical error that caused him to be unable to compete in sword, but I thought that was a bit of a push for him. I guess everyone is so programed to hate the USAWKF that they will do anything they can to take a shot at it.  I must say I am not to thrilled that I got stuck at the 3-star.  No one at the 5-star has gotten sick so far.

I am just annoyed that we had to go and mar the team with politics this year.  I understand that it wasn't like this at all 2 years ago.  But they also had worlds jackets and a decent organizing committee there.  The Vietnam is lacking.  Heck, Vietnam is a bit lacking for me right now.  Well, maybe not the entire country -- but I don't much care for this Hanoi place.

Despite my state of unpleasantness this evening I was able to talk to some of the other countries some more.  I even gave up a pin to the Netherlands with out getting one.  Signed Germany's jacket -- right on the collar where everyone can see my name nice and big.  Aside from the sickness this is a pretty damn cool thing to be apart of.

Need to rest, I have duilan tomorrow.  While I don't expect to be 100% by then, I figure the more rest I can get the closer I will be.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Woke up feeling better, not great, but better.  I really think taking the Cipro early has saved me alot of pain.  I talked to some of the sanshou people at lunch and they all seemed to suffer more than I did.  Deep down, I know it was the people praying for me back home that whipped me back so quick.

I struggled through breakfast, I wanted some of the French toast they were making but it was way undercooked so I just left it and opted for the toast and jam (no butter).  I really thought I should eat more, but that was as much as I could handle at the time so I went with that.  We grabbed our stuff and hopped the bus to the stadium.  During warm ups I was feeling weak, but it is a fighting set, so I had Stephon's energy to help push me.  We were 8th to go, and our event came up fast.  We walked out there and did our thing.  Apparently Sifu saw my first move and was nervous that I was too sick, because I had no power, flavor or snap to it at all.  But once we got going things were a little better.  I felt off, stephon said the same, but in the end were more on than off.  Fighting sets are tricky like that, so much depends on timing and distance, that speed and style aren't such a big factor.  End of the day we pulled a 9.35 out of nowhere.  Putting us in 6th.  I was just hoping for 9--I will take it. Not to bad for the inaugural US duilain.

We went to lunch at the daewoo hotel, the 5 star we were supposed to stay at. The buffet was insane, you would pay $30, $40 for that back in the states.  It was like our own personal heaven in Hanoi.  I was so happy.  I was feeling better so I could eat, and the food was so good.  And best of all it was not the food at the sunny hotel.  Because I have learned to hate that food.  I don't think I want another glass of tang for a long, long time.  Watered down tang.  Ugh.  But, the daewoo, oh, the daewoo.  I know I used to associate that name with cheap cars, but never more, I will think scalloped potatoes, new England clam chowder and tempura shrimp from now on.  I didn't over eat, not even too much desert (just a little rum raisin ice cream), but I just sat there, being happy.  I felt clean for a little while.

I know I was excited about this trip to China before we came here, more excited about it than worlds.  But at this point I am way more pumped about going home.  I wanna play with my cats, sleep in my bed, take a shower that stays hot the entire time.  Worlds was awesome, I think china will be fun, but going home....sweet....home.

Most of all I want to see my wife.  Where is my wife? WIFE! C'MERE!!!

<content:encoded><![CDATA[The closing ceremonies took a long time.  They had the final match for each division in Sanshou, plus a medal ceremony between every third match.  It just dragged on forever.  By the time we were done I was exhausted.  A couple of interesting events happed during this otherwise boring time.
<ol><li>We had a US Taolu team meeting. During which we discussed the on goings that could have been seriously detrimental to the team. 'Could' have been, but they weren’t so there was nothing but a few really annoyed people.  Painful, but not bad.</li><li>Stephon was asked by coach to bring something back for her.  He was assured this was little.  We had to wait until after everything was finished before he could go get it.  This little object ultimately wound up taking up half the huge suitcase and caused us to be overweight leaving Vietnam.  However we were not charged for it, it was just frustrating.  Again, involved annoyed people but didn’t wind up bad.</li><li>I had been talking all week how I wanted one of the banners that hung in and around the arena.  I noticed some of the boys from Turkmenistan were taking them all down.  I immediately ran up and investigated, hoping to get one for my self.  As I reached the top on the boys ran by, yanked it down and threw it at me saying "Take it."  How happy is that?  I don’t even think I stole it, since that boy gave it to me.  Not sure quite how that works since I saw him take it down.  I don’t even think the Vietnam federation is annoyed, because when are they going to use 8th WWC banners again?</li><li>Sarah distributed flyers for the after party she was hosting.  Since the Vietnam Federation didn’t see to host any sort of afterparty or banquet Sarah (and I am guessing her father) took it upon herself to host one.  They rented out the restaurant on the top floor of the Sunny Hotel.  Not the nicest place, but for something like $500 they had the room for most of the night and a bunch of free drinks.
</li></ol>During the afore mentioned after party I went up and hung out for a little while--while Stephon was retrieving the afore mentioned 'little' package.  Since I was tired I didn’t get around to being social with a lot of the new people I had met.  Honestly, I spent most of my time talking to Jordana and Paula about being an expectant father. (Wait, is this the first time I mentioned it on this blog?  I think so.  Kelly and I are expecting. I wasn’t allowed to talk about it here because we were not telling people yet. I guess we are now.)  I thought it was a little strange that I was talking about vast amounts of responsibility when nearly everyone around me was drinking them selves into very uncomfortable plane rides the next day.  Eventually I went down, made sure I was completely packed and crashed.  I remember being awoken around 5 or so in the morning to yells of "Where’s the next party!  Woo!" and thinking I was happy I was getting a few hours of sleep.

We were downstairs early for the bus, eventually Joana and her mom showed up and we were off to the airport.  Once we were on our way, and some of the grogginess finally cleared we realized that Tiff was supposed to be on our flight.  I sorta panicked, we got the driver to call someone, and everyone seemed to think things were under control.  I let the grogginess take over again.  Luckily we saw her show up at the airport, appearing properly groggy.  I made a point to make sure she was OK getting through border control and customs in Guangzhou and Beijing.  Not that we were doing that much better, we tried to skip that stuff in Beijing.  Luckily they let us back on the skyway from the terminal and were able to take the tram to the luggage collection adventure.

We met Marc at the Beijing airport.  We got in line for a cab.  They got in and left.  WE were getting in when the cabbie said no.  He didn't like the long weapons.  I should have just put them in and talked about it once I was finished.  They made us take a freekin mini bus, and wanted 300 freekin kuai.  We argued, but he was the only one, and didn’t budge.  Even once we got to Shichahai, he made Stephon pay him the 20 kuai toll.  I thought we shoulda walked on him, but I think Stephon was intimidated and I can understand.  Strange country, you won’t want to rip someone off and get mixed up with the cops.  Even thought I think if the cops were involved they would have arrested the driver for charging 300 kuai for a 70 kuai trip.  I was pissed.  Right off the plane in Beijing, we were taken.

The hotel at Shichahai was n-i-c-e.  Everything around it was so new and different.  Hohai, the area next to the school, was now this hot new bar scene. None of that was there before.  Of course when Stephon and I tried to go get dinner I wanted to go to this little restaurant that I liked so much from last time.  But it was gone.  Replaced with some scary meat pie something.  We didn’t go in.  We wandered for a wile and tried this place across the street from KFC where we got jaiozi and tang su li ji.  Stephon didn’t like the tangsu li ji.  I did.  Sweet and tangy, and deep fried to happiness.

After eating we went back and crashed. [Boom](http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/wushu/2005worlds).]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[After crashing hard that first night in Shichahai we set out to do some sight seeing.  This was only my second trip, and Stephon's first, so we needed to get some of the big stuff checked off.  We ruled out the great wall because of time constraints, and I had been to the summer palace, so we opted for the Forbidden City.  This also had the bonus of being right next to Tiananmen square, which was another place I wanted to visit.

After struggling to get a cab we rolled up and hopped out across the street from the infamous plaza.  The moment our feet hit the ground we were mobbed by people trying to sell us an odd assortment of gloves and Beijing 2008 ski caps.  This was OK by us, as we wanted to get some Beijing 2008 ski caps.  We bargained with the first guy, who wanted 10 kuai each.  We got 3 for 20.  The next guy with the nicer hats gave use 5 for 30.  8 ski caps in our bag later (well, 7+1 on Stephon's nearly bald head) we were off.  We took a few touristy pictures around the square.  I got my au batido picture in front of Mao's picture on the southern gate.  We gave the mausoleum disapproving looks.  And tried to not think about tanks if we could help it.  We did send one street vender on a mission for a scarf for Stephon.  She promptly made a call and came a running with a small selection.  Setphon picked one and we figured we couldn't talk her down too much (I think she wanted 40 kuai) so we just got her to throw in a free pair of gloves.  And set out to discover what only eunuchs could see, in the years of yore.  (Does China have years of yore?).

We found us some self guided audio tours, as read by Rodger Moore (yeah 007!) and paid our entry fee.  The audio tour was probably the best 45 kuai we spent the entire time there.  We wondered around, discovering all sorts of coolness.  Including [proof](http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/wushu/2005worlds/IMG_1509.jpg.html) that at least one Emperor was a UMD fan.

After the forbidden city, we hopped in a cab which took us the long way 'round to get to Wang Fu Jing.  Did some shopping.  Ate some dumplings.  Drank Starbucks.  It was good.  We had a great time wandering thought he ally ways bargaining for all sorts of crazy crap.

I think that about rounds up our day.

Next day we got up and chaise brought us over to the wushu guan for some demo practice watching.  Mark was there, as well as Joanna.  We hung out and video taped for some time before the coach caught us and made us stop taping, so we just watched after that.  Beijing, Siquan and Fujian (?) teams were getting ready for some big demo.  So we basically got to see the demo that BJWT did for their US tour as well as some extra fun.

After they were finished we got s few pictures with some of the extra cool team members and headed our for lunch.  Chase took us to what I figure is his favorite place to eat, Hu Tong Pizza.  I was surprised, it was good pizza, in Beijing.  Apparently it is owned by some American guy that bought a little hutong and converted it to his restaurant.  Very cool place to visit. Oh, and free hot water.

Post lunch meant buying weapons.  Marck rounded up Wudi and Tiff and we headed out to the sports university to get the stuff.  We found the little shop, and they agreed that we could go to the real shop and get the real stuff.  So we followed some guy who lead us a few blocks away, down and ally, through some disturbing steel door into what I think is the shop owner's house.  There was a busted old building next to it with a big padlock on the door.  They cracked it open and we went in.  There were actually two rooms.  The main room with a display case and a bunch of VCDs, and the sketchier room next to it with more wushu weapons then you can shake a gun at.  (gunshu de gun)

We gathered our loot and made a big pile.  I asked for VCDs of competition, but they said they had none (I hear Mark made out with their entire stock, sneaky guy). They added our stuff up and it came to a grand total of 2045 kuai.  I bargained.  This guy was tuff.  At first he was going to take off a nice 45 kuai.  I laughed at him.  I offered 1700 kuai and he laughed at me.  Eventually we settled on 1900 kuai and I figure I did just fine.  This was good, because all the money we had left we needed the taxi ride back.  During said taxi ride we decided to strike a deal with the driver to take us the airport, as we tend to have trouble getting a taxi to take our long weapons (they often say no, and drive away).  We told him to meet use outside of Shichahai the next morning.  I even gave him 50 kuai instead of the 28 for the fair as a bonus.  We were now broke.

Did more shopping.

Later we met up with Mark again for dinner.  He took us to a sweet Korean place where everything they serve is on a stick.  Chicken on a stick, lamb on a stick, bread on a stick, chicken neck on a stick.  You name it.  I didn't care for the neck, too many bones.

After dinner we hit up one of the many new bars in hohai.  It was a little quite pub, with four or five tables.  Mark taught us some fun games, Stephon discovered Long Island Iced Tea.  It was great fun, and much needed relaxing after all the stress.

The final day involved hauling all our stuff to the sidewalk out front of the school.  I was standing there with a huge pile of luggage waiting for Stephon to bring the long weapons around when a taxi pulled up and offered to take me to the airport.  I faced a little problem.  This guys was here now.  He drove a beat ups 1.60 red cab which made him more likely to take the long weapons.  I could load all our stuff before Stephon came 'round with the long weapons, so I figured he was unlikely to refuse us and unload us.  And we had no way of getting on touch with the other guy to make sure he was going to make it.  I decided I needed the sure thing.  I felt really bad, but I needed to get to the airport.  Once we were fully loaded and started to go our guy showed up.  I covered my face and said 'zuo le' a few times real quick.  Man, I felt horrible. I had decided if he showed up while we were loading, I was gonna give him a few bucks to make it worth his wile, but were already rolling.  Dang it, he even showed up early.

We were properly punished in the airport with some absurdly long waits.  WE waited something like 3 hours before Continental even got a counter for our flight.  Once they did we stood there milling around before they actually did anything.  One thing they did do was rearrange the queue, moving those little seat-belt like barriers on us.  Making our third in like more like fifth in line.  No real harm, just a bit annoying.

Long, long plane ride home.  Long wait for luggage in Newark.  Barely made it to the gate in time, they were literally shutting the door as we got there.  Needless to say, our oversized baggage didn't show up in National.  We filed a claim and went home.  All our stuff was delivered the next morning.

We were greeted in DC by family holding signs saying "Welcome Home" and "Jiayou" -- they even had a little chant.  It was awesome. And his mom.

Let me tell you what I like:  Signs in English.  American food, well, food made in America, I am including Mexican, Italian and the like in this.  My own bed.  My cats. My wife. Heck, even my job (weird).

I think Stephon would have been happy staying in Beijing.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Then Richmond.  Then Waldorf.

Kelly and I completed our annual Christmas rounds again this year.  Started in burke, we exchanged presents early.  <img src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/blog/image/595/IMG_1715.jpg" align="right">Mostly because I get excited and can't wait, but also because if we start early we will have more days of presents in a row--5 total.  I had to chance the last minute shopping because of that whole trip to Asia thing, but I knew what I wanted to buy, something that I had been wanting to get the wife for quite a while.  We exchanged gifts, and Kelly easily won.  I got a digital SLR.  All I gave her was a diamond tennis bracelet.  Only problem is you spell diamond with a 'C' and a 'Z'.  It is very nice, good quality, and petite.  I should take a picture with my new camera.

The new camera rocks, btw.  I am working to learn how to more properly use it.  I have my Dad's old fully manual 35mm SLR, and have used it with very limited success.  The Canon EOS 350D is so nice, I love the creative settings where you can tell it to make all but one setting automatic.  So I can do things like experiment with the aperture and the focus, shutter speed, et. al. will be taken care of.  Very good for someone who wants to learn what exactly everything does, but isn't quite sure yet.

<img src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/blog/image/595/IMG_1680.jpg" align="left">The next day after work we had dinner with our chosen family, and exchanged a few presents--over Mongolian BBQ.  And that was the end of the calm.  We loaded up and headed to Richmond.  <img src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/blog/image/595/IMG_1664.jpg" align="right">Richmond was very incremental this year.  Breakfast and gifts with the Anderson's.  Five Guys. Afternoon at the Wilson's.  Evening at Grandma's.  Much lower key this year, I think the cousins are getting older.  And at Christmas older means boring.   Luckily we have Joshua and Jacob to keep some life in it. Oh, and Darth Vader too.

After grandma's back up to Burke.

<img src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/blog/image/595/IMG_1748.jpg" align="left"></a>Christmas morning was loading up the car, cats and all, and 'round the belt way to Waldorf we go. You would think all the old boring people involved that it would be dull, but there were ipods, nintendos and tivos being tossed around, so we kept the dull at bay.  Of course it was a step down from last year's unicycle, but that's just presents.

Kelly and her mom made the most spectacular dinner.  They had the most amazing Beef Wellingtons ever made. Still properly pink, so tender, and the puff-pastry wasn't soggy in the least.  I wanted to eat two.  I nearly exploded after one and a half.

I was really happy to see so much family.  Especially the Andersons, Wilsons and Tulli -- I think next year when we have extra pitter-patter'ring at our house we are going to have to switch to a 3 year rotation.  Home, Richmond, and Waldorf -- otherwise there is no way we can get any sort of quality time in there at all.  I say year one starts in Burke. Of course I could just be sick of traveling from my little jaunt to as-far-away-as-you-can-go land.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[And that is sad.  I didn't go with him, he went on his own to the springfield location.  Maybe he forgot to get a burger while he was there.

I don't really have the time to stop and write, but I ran into a problem and I am waiting for an email back.  So I wanted to jot something down.  Plus jiayo is slow today so I am not distracted by that.

Has anyone else noticed that any and all press about VT is all Vick leg stepping?  I was thoroughly pissed when we saw that, and I am hoping for some sort of punishment that hurts, but c'mon guys.  The ref that hasn't seen anything that bad in his 22 year career seems a bit sensationalistic.  Marcus was a jerk, but we have seen much worse things happen that got 15 yards at the most. I never wished google alerts would pick up some basketball stuff so bad.

Tom came over for the USC-Texas insano game last night.  That game was insano.  I am glad there are no more games this week because I need sleep.

Kelly wants a post about awesome. Prolly a long, long post.  But that's kinda hard, the kid really doesn't' do too much.  (S)He and Kelly are attached at the hip, or something.  Boring.  Once the kid learns to kick then we got something to work with.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[This stuff is bad for you, I don't recomend reading this, I jsut wanted to keep it around because of how emotionally invested I was in it at the time.

A little stuff to keep around for posterity sake.  I lost a lot of sleep over this one and wrote some long, long responces that I never posted.

Either way I wanted to keep it here because that forum has a habit of loosing it's old posts.

I started with this, in response to they way wushu was trending in the world, not just the USA.  The name of the thread was "The Downfall of US Wushu"

Fuzzymonk - Wed Jan 04, 2006 4:01
<blockquote>I see the current changes in wushu being driven by the changes in the rules. This prevents competitors from sticking to 'pure' wushu and showing solid basics and simpler jumps. If you decide "this new stuff sucks, I am going to play it the old school way," you would get rocked by the people that do what the judges want to see.

I agree with icy, if we just require a certain jibengong people could just start their form with mabu->gongbu->pubu and get it over with. I think that compulsory stances are a great idea, but the implementation needs to be clever enough to prevent embarrassment.

I am not sure what you mean by "gymnastics rules", but I do not think going back to the old system would help, the need to standardized rules with specific guidelines for the judges is an absolute must. The old judging deferred to the personal preference angle a bit too much for a sport.</blockquote>

Jiayo (Brandon) - Thu Jan 05, 2006 11:27 pm
<blockquote>
true.

so then all coaches and athletes should have equal access to information regarding the rules. officials, such as technical committee members and federation board members, should be available to explain the rules to coaches and athletes.

if athletes who are members of the national federation ask clear and specific questions about how rules are to be applied during competition, they should be given those answers.

a competition sport is also bound by something called sportsmanship.

it would have been sportsman-like to share the information that you and other Omei students were given, by Lu Xiaolin, weeks before team trials when you absolutely knew that there were other athletes that were asking Lu Xiaolin for that information and were being denied access to it.

agree or disagree? i know Peter Wolf asked you guys about it and you tried to play it off. you know i called you guys out on it on this forum right after trials and not a single one of you responded to it.

so here's your chance to respond now. i'm asking you as a friend and a fellow competitor.</blockquote>
 Jianshu also commented.  It was this post that really pushed me to respond.  He was polite, civil and to the point.

Jianshu - Fri Jan 06, 2006 10:11 pm<blockquote>So what of it Chris, Stephon, et al?

There seems to be proof of some unsportsmanlike behavior to take advantage... if you were afraid to tell others, or held onto the information for your own gain (or were instructed to), why not just admit it. Time to man up. I believe you owe the other competitors that much at least, don't you think? At least people would know that you're honest about your role. This silence from your end is certainly damning.

If these statements were false, I imagine you certainly would have defended your position long before now...</blockquote>

My big response

Fuzzymnk - Sat Jan 07, 2006 4:33 pm <blockquote>
Brandon,

I know I am only going to regret responding. I have been advised that participating on forums like this will only bring me grief, but I was naive. Or maybe idealistic. Lets go with idealistic.

I did post responses before, however not in (what I considered) your antagonistic calling out thread. I gave (what I considered) direct answers to peter. He didn't like my responses then, and I bet you won't like them now. On the bright side, I do appreciate that the accusations are less vicious now than they were immediately following team trials.

I would really appreciate it if people had a problem with me to come to me directly. Calling someone out on the forum does not count in my opinion. A lack of a response on a message board is not the same as to refusing to answer. Personally, I would consider email a direct means of contact, or over the phone. I'd be more than happy to talk in person if anyone wants to come to DC. And when I get the chance to travel I'd be happy to meet you where you are.

You say we cheated because we knew rules that you did not. You had the same rule book we did (I am not trying to be a jerk here; I think this is fairly significant). In fact I went though great trouble to make sure there was an easy to read web version of it (however not official in any way). I know the specific information you are talking about, that you say was given to us by my coach, but crazy as it sounds I did not find out about this from my coach--she wasn't even around. I found out about it from this forum. We heard news from the Canadian trials how they were deducting for improper basics but the stances without guidelines specifically laid out in the rules had no means to get deducted. Yep, verifiable a loophole. The same judges were headed to the US Team Trials so common sense said we should be prepared for the same thing to happen here. I would speculate that the IWuF officials had the final word as to the interpretation of the rules, not the federation.

But wait there is more. O-Mei was at it before we knew anything about the basics deductions. We hired an international judge and an accomplished choreographer and flew him over here form China. Something any school can do and many do, equivalent to going to China to work with the experts there on new forms. And there is no question that happens all the time. We paid him nicely to fine tune our forms (or in some cases create them from scratch). One of the many changes he made was to the basics in my forms, at the time I had no idea that it was of any significance. Nor did he specifically tell my why he changed the moves he did. In fact I found it somewhat strange and argued about the changes at times. However, it was clear at trials that people from our school who took the chorography seminars tended to score better than those who did not. In some cases with drastic results. And you know what? We all trained together, tried to help each other, and wanted the best for everyone.

I guess you could you could say some O-Mei students had an advantage over O-Mei students, although we certainly didn't recognize it as such. Our ability or willingness to pay for additional coaching got us access to better training and better choreography, even if that didn't include better explanations which we could then turn around and share with our teammates, friends, and fellow athletes in the broader community.

Had I avoided any attempts at serious productive discussion and stuck to the Chuck Norris jokes this would have passed with out incident.

My offer for personal conversations still stands - I want to see this sport get to a better place, just like you do.

Chris</blockquote>

Then we started getting helpers

blackie615 -  Sun Jan 08, 2006 1:12 am  <blockquote> Yeah I agree with fuzzy that the rules were available, but when were they available? Also, how come the people running the tournament or the judges or officials of usawkf didn't tell how they were going to interpret the rules? This is not an accusation to you fuzzy, I'm not saying you did or did not...all I'm saying is the federation should have did whatever in their powers to not only present the rules but also tell the competitors how they were going to interpret it at team trials....free of cost i might add.

im also wondering...was the rules interpreted the same way at teams as it was at worlds...i wasnt at both but i would just like to know to clear some confusion i have. </blockquote>

jiayo - Sun Jan 08, 2006 5:09 am    <blockquote>Chris,

If you are saying that Lu Xiaolin did not explicitly tell you and others, upon return from the Canadian team trials, that you should change your forms and take out certain stances and movements because she knew that the same criteria would be used at the US Team Trials...then this is not what I had interpretted from my conversations with others. If this is true, then this changes my perspective.

However, my observations would lead me to suspect otherwise. I spoke with a parent of an Omei student who made the team. This parent said that Lu Xiaolin changed her child's form immediately prior to trials. Why would she do that?

I find it way too suspicious. I asked Lu Xiaolin straight up about the rules. I asked how deductions would be made. I asked weeks before the competition. I got no answer. The only thing I got from her was that there would be a meeting the night before team trials where the rules would be explained. Everyone shows up at the meeting and, surprise, the rules will indeed be be interpretted as the Canadian team trials were. And, suprise, most of the Omei students who make the team and received high scores have forms that have obviously been choreographed to exclude basic, fundamental techniques.

And one comment about bringing in coaches. Were the coaches that were brought in to teach forms at Ome the same coaches as those that were present at trials? Rui-Qi Zhu and Tong-Wei Liu?

Perhaps no one is guilty of anything. Perhaps everyone's hands are clean. Perhaps I'm a complete asshole who is jealous and like's to talk shit.

But what do you think the rest of the competitors at team trials and the rest of the world is thinking right now? People are coming to conclusions based on the information in front of them. As competitive athletes, we put ourselves out there. The entire world is watching.

9.87 dude. 9.87.</blockquote>

I felt like he asked questions I already answered, and tried to put words in my mouth, so I let my original post stand.  Oh, I wrote a few responses.  The first was 5 pages in length, but decided not to post any of them.

Trolls (aka blackie)

master^-^bait - Sun Jan 08, 2006 6:12 pm <blockquote>

So... How can you call yourself a U.S. Team Member when YOU, CHRISTOPHER, used a loophole to get on the team? This is just unrespectable. :Twisted Evil:</blockquote>

svninchwushu - Mon Jan 09, 2006 2:50 am<blockquote>
master bait- u are unrespectable.

Chris is a good person, and hard working athlete.

hes not afraid to stand by his name, why dont u do the same. I think if u posted your name- everything u said would become obviously less credible.

Lucas</blockquote>

yourwife - Mon Jan 09, 2006 3:49 am<blockquote>
whoa whoa whoa come now....that last post by master bait was not offensive..yeah fuzzy is a good person and i dont doubt he's hard working athlete but that has nothing to do with taking advantage of a loophole as he, chris, said himself.

masterbait made an opinion and a reasonable one. he's just not giving chris as much props for making the team and i hope people can respect that (what? i hope not everyone expects it to be a perfect world)...its much better than "you suck" or "you are gay"

svninchwushu if you think you are "better" than some people on this forum, then please dont "drop down" to their level when posting...speaking of credibility..you just lost some in my book :D

i never knew a person's character had anything to do with their actions...good people can still do bad things...bad people can still do good things. you want the truth? i dont think you can handle the truth!!!

---
in my opinion chris is not very respectable simply because he knew about the so called "loopholes" but did he care to share?
</blockquote>

svninchwushu - Mon Jan 09, 2006 4:36 am<blockquote>
yourwife- yet another person who refuses to ever state their name-

not impressed with your attempts to sound reasonable.

you have made it quite clear you are not sensible. you talk in cirlces. masterbait did not state a reasonable opinion. He made a disrespectful and ignorant post, as he has done before. I never claimed to be "better" - and that is another obvious attempt to apply ambigous terms in attempt to post a seemingly well organized argument- (ie. you're typing things, but not really saying anything of importance).

"i never knew a person's character had anything to do with their actions." this doesnt even make sense unless its sarcasm. while ur second point about good people/bad things and vice/versa has validity, your first comment seems to be a pathetic attempt to say somthing intelligent sounding.

Lucas

why are masterbait and yourwife afraid to post their names??</blockquote>

yourwife - Mon Jan 09, 2006 6:59 am<blockquote>
1. Chris admit there was a loophole he took advantage of it and didnt share it with other athletes...i believe the word shady falls under unrespectable..if he shared it, people wouldnt be complaining about the rules in the first place...if he shared the rules how come the high scorers tended to be from omei..9.87 cmon now..no one outside of omei was close to that.

2. masterbait made a point, you lashed out on him..why? maybe its the truth and it hurts in the a$$ to know your deity with the best aerial twist on earth doesnt really have the best aerial twist...oh i mean didnt make the team fairly, but since you are so bent on saying its an ignorant comment..you're no different from him with comments like "master bait- u are unrespectable"

3. i never said you were claiming to be better...read it again..it says IF...so if it doesnt apply to you no need to get your pink panties in a bunch but since you're defensive maybe those panties are a bit too small for u

*i'm glad you are so curious to find out my name but i'm not trying to play hard to get *hint hint*</blockquote>

Jianshu - Mon Jan 09, 2006 7:06 am<blockquote>
Well, back to the real issue.

I respect Chris for answering the questions he was asked. If what he says is the truth, and he didn't realize the choreographers and his coach LXL were taking advantage of a loophole until the last second, then there would be no reason to share with other athletes. If the buzz throughout their school wasn't about how basic stances wouldn't be used and so forth, there would be no cause to tell any other athletes beforehand. So, since information wasn't shared in an open manner, hopefully what he has written IS the truth.

That would mean that the owness falls on LXL, who knew absolutely about the judging criteria beforehand, who changed her own students forms to fit that criteria beforehand, and who refused to answer athletes such as Brandon and Tiffany when they asked about those very judging criteria. To me, this is the worst part of the whole situation, as it is her responsibility to share this information. Information they are certainly entitled to. If she had answered the email questions outright instead of hiding that information, none of us would be having this discussion about who didn't tell who and why.

It's a sad day when someone with so much power, who's job is to keep all competitors informed and on as even a playing field as possible, withholds vital information like this. She wanted her students to win? Fine. She hired choreographers to build them new routines? Fine. She wants to use her judging powers and influence to help her students receive blown up scores? That's wrong. Sure, it's common place in all athletics (and keeps happening at her tournaments), but that is wrong. She wants to withhold information that it is her job to share, so that her students gain such an undeniable advantage that they are virtually guaranteed a spot on the team? That's so far beyond the line it isn't even funny. And with all the previous actions taken care of, why is it even necessary to do this? It seems like overkill to me, and obviously complete abuse of power.

Oh and btw, my comments are not those of a jilted athlete who didn't make the team, but arise from listening to the circumstances surrounding this and past competitions. To me, the athletes who got screwed (Brandon for instance) have every right to be up in arms.

masterbait did not state a reasonable opinion. He made a disrespectful and ignorant post, as he has done before.

Reasonable opinion? All I posted was a small question... Why is an opinion needed for that? And you say I'm disrespectful? Even if I am but isn't it more disrespectful to know how rules are implied for an important competition that only happens every two years and not share it with anyone?

Sigh...

Now that that's over, I would still like an answer to my question.

Luke

and for clarification- masterbait, your comment about chris and his respectability- was a comment, not a question (questions end with one of these (?).

They spat for a while and the flaming continues.  Mario even makes a calling them out thread hoping to get them banned.

Replying to Jianshu's post

jiayo - Mon Jan 09, 2006 9:31 pm<blockquote>if Lu Xiaolin is unable to balance her positions of:

1) coach
2) IWuF technical committee member
3) USAWKF board member
4) sometimes judge

then she should not be serving in a official capacity. if she is not making every effort to keep the system unbiased and trying to give equal access to information, then she should step down or be removed from office.

just because she didn't act as a judge at trials, doens't mean she didn't leverage her power to influence the outcome.

comments?</blockquote>

svninchwushu - Tue Jan 10, 2006 2:23 am<blockquote>just at first glance- this is speaking not as her student but as a realist (thats not an idealist), and is completely off the books-

jiayo wrote "if she is not making every effort to keep the system unbiased and trying to give equal access to information, then she should step down or be removed from office. just because she didn't act as a judge at trials, doens't mean she didn't leverage her power to influence the outcome. "

well couldn't this be her perogitive (sp?). if one holds a position of power don't they typically (not ideally) seek to gain from that power. I feel she is being said to do, what I presume, just about every single gymnastics, ice skating, (insert olympic sport) official- does. pull strings/provide relavent inside info. It seems like a lot of you complain about it but never really say that this is how much of the world works, why would wushu be any different?

obviously this argument is not a 'justification', just an observation. If this were the case it wouldn't make everything ok. Im just making a point.

Luke

Im not trying to get flamed. This was not in any way representive of LXL, just a thought I had in reading brandons post.</blockquote>

jiayo - Tue Jan 10, 2006 2:53 am <blockquote>that's an interesting post, lucas.

for the past few months, i've been requesting access to the USAWKF by-laws. i've asked specifically how board members are elected/appointed. so far, the USAWKF has given me no answers.

the reason i bring this up is this:
if there are no rules or laws that Lu Xiaolin or any other board member is breaking...is what they are doing wrong or right? if they are not breaking any local, state or federal laws...is there anything that can be done?

then, it's only a question of morality, sportsmanship, and fairness. (though, i would argue, these are big things)

no one is forcing us to be members of the USAWKF. no one is forcing us to go to team trials. we could simply say "fuck it" and not have anything to do with them.

the only issue is: if you want to represent your country at Worlds, you MUST be a member of the USAWKF and you must compete at team trials.</blockquote>

We get trolls of our own!  Nice polite ones. This one quoted my post.
Chavarria -  Tue Jan 10, 2006 9:50 pm
<blockquote>I don't call that cheating. I call it being smart.
You know you would have done the same so stop picking on Chris!
You people are just jealous of his accomplishment at worlds. admit it?
</blockquote>

And right nwo jianshu has the final word:

Jianshu - Tue Jan 10, 2006 10:26 pm <blockquote>Well, since I didn't compete, I would certainly not say that I'm interested in this topic due to jealousy. This concerns the future of US wushu and every competitor outside of their school. That is why I'm interested.

The main issue here is, people were trying to find out if the Omei students had an unfair advantage. An advantage given to them (explicitly or not) by their coach. Their coach who happens to be in charge of the organization. Their coach who's job it is to disseminate crucial information such as this, to all athletes. Especially ones who SPECIFICALLY asked for it weeks prior to the competition.

IT IS THEIR RIGHT TO KNOW THESE DETAILS PRIOR TO COMPETITION. No, I don't mean less than 12 hours before competition. Is that plain enough for you? As a head official and organizer it is simply wrong to withhold this information. PERIOD.

So the reason Chris was asked about this is because it seemed he, as a fellow competitor should share this information too, if asked, in the spirit of sportsmanship. He replied fully to the questions saying he did not know about said judging criteria beforehand. So if that's truly the case, no, he morally shouldn't need to share the info.

As to your comment about us all doing that same, that is complete BS. Brandon and the rest of the people here did their utmost to share all information they had. Did they have to do that? No. But in the spirit of community here, it was the right thing to do.

Not everyone does the right thing. I think we've heard what you would do in the same situation, Chavarria. Which could be exactly the thing pulling US wushu down.

I respect you for trying to stand up for Chris, but I think he's doing just fine on his own.</blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

Monday was a holiday (well, floating holiday, and I did do some work Monday night), and yesterday we had a meeting with a client in Herndon so I just went out there for the morning. I worked from home in the afternoon, but coding with a cat in your lap is much less like work.  I got free pho for lunch which kept me happy for a while.

Getting pho was fun.  The product manager form the client took us out and asked if there were any pho newbies.  Our CEO pointed out that I was in Vietnam a few weeks ago and suddenly I was the guy to ask for suggestions.  I recommended not tripe.

This past weekend was an easy weekend.  Cleaned up the house a little, did some home projects (dart board is back up), hung out with my little sister and her husband-to-be, watched the Skins loose and the Steelers win, eat tasty chili, and train for our new years demo.

Highlight of the weekend had to be the chili.  Kelly made it for everyone who came over to watch the football game (They get TLN's: Tom, Mer, Nik and Ant) and it was good.  Not as spicy as last time, and I prefer the spicier version, but really tasty anyway.  Plus that meant I got to have chili dogs for the next couple dinners.

Monday we hung out with Sean and Nina again over at his parents place, which meant we got to see Max again.  Dinner there was surprisingly good (thai curry chicken) and the board game we played looked like it could have been fun, but the rules discussion went on forever. It was way to RPG for Kelly's tastes...and probably for mine too. It made kill doctor lucky feel like a fasted paced tornado of excitement.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[My boss commented on my new kicks today and asked if I did actually play indoor soccer.  I had to say no.  And nope, I don't watch it either.  But if you break the shoes in real good you can use them for wushu.

Kelly pointed out that I could play indoor soccer, and then I wouldn't be a poser.  So I have the potential for not being one, but, currently I am.

Anyone know where I can get the Ris paul ric CD?  I have only found one place to order it, but I would rather buy it a brick and mortar establishment.  Of course I have waited so long for the instant gratification that if I did it the non-instant way I would be currently gratified.

Chinese New Year is this weekend (Sunday) so I have demos.  I am currently officially slated for on at Mason on Saturday night, and there are rumors of one on Sunday afternoon, but I have yet to receive official word on that yet.  I had been planning on going downtown with Duane to taka some pictures.

A parting gift: Resistance may be futile, but capacitance has potential.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[The deep maroon and bright orange would have been ok if we did a football themed nursery, but I think I am going to have to go with the kites theme now.  You can get away with programming football into a boy, but it seems strange to force that upon a girl.

Oh, in other news we are having a girl!  It's little Leah Marie. Least that is how Kelly wants to spell it.  I'd be happy with 力-ah, but that seems strange to force that upon a girl.

We went in and got the big sonogram, complete with the guided tour of the belly.  Kelly started out lying there with a bit of an apprehensive look on her face, but that quickly turned into a big grin and an occasional coo of "awww" whenever we looked at fingers or toes.  It was pretty momentous to stand there and watch the 4 chambers of the heat pumping away. I can sum it up in one word: Unsettledbewilderedawe. (Yes that is one word, do you see any spaces) It was a bit strange to stare at our child's alien appearance.  The way the ultra sound took a cross section of the scull, spine and ribs can be a little befuddling.

I was strangely nervous going into the appointment today.  Kelly even noted how she wasn't required to pry me from the warm comfy bed like she normally does.  She went off to shower and I was up and (mostly) dressed when she was done.  I didn't want to be late.  I was plenty fidgety, I don’t know if it was nerves over the unknown gender or the more noble concern over the wellbeing of Awesome.  Er, Leah.  But the doc said there is no reason for concern, everything looks good.  She did point out that the OB was a bit off in they due date estimate, and it looks like we are about 17 weeks.  They estimate the due date to be July 4th.  Coolest birthday ever.  Who needs candles when you got fireworks?  If everything goes according to plan I will have to play The Boss during delivery.

Now Kelly is all giddy with visions of little dresses and pigtails.

And now, baby's first pictures:

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Well, we finished our barrage of new years demos.  I feel like we got off easy this year, we only had two demos.  One big one, which we actually involved some rather involved training went exceptionally well.  It was at some sort of Chinese school gathering, which I think involved multiple Chinese schools, in a fancy new high school auditorium.  We had our performance timed out, the music was edited and spliced together to make sure things had good flow between events.  We finished off the demo with a bit of comic relief provided by a monkey and an unbearably cute little Chinese girl.  The Sunday demo was just silly.  We had a lot of events perform, I think Virginia did 6, I personally did 3 and the old lady that was running the show loved to talk.  And then she would translate herself into Chinese just in case.  Tom and the Tulli showed up for the show, which was great to have them come out, but I think I would have preferred a less silly show.

Well, let me take a moment and be honest with my self.  Wushu is just silly.  I mean, floppy swords? C'mon.

After the demo Kelly and I took the rest of her family to china star and we celebrated the new year properly: by eating Chinese food.  I think I may have tended toward the spicy side a bit too much, but it is a siquanese place, so I can't take all the blame.  I still really like china star, but I think the new owners are not good for the place.  For one all the dimsum stuff is off the menu. The new years special foods (specifically pumpkin cakes) are no longer being offered.  And some of the dishes just don’t' fee as authentic as they used to. A year ago the food there was identical to the dishes I would have gotten in china, but now it seems to be slipping away. I am afraid that it is going the same was as Peking Village, the place that was amazing with the best guo tie ever, underwent some management changes and now, well, is [associate]( http://www.wethotamericansummer.com/).  (i.e.  less than -- group hug) Finding authentic and convenient chinese food seems to be getting trickier.   哎呀

Leah got some new clothes.  I think this makes Kelly happy.  She got a little pink dress onesie with flowers and everything.  Kelly's mom even brought over some of Kelly's old baby clothes, which where properly coo'd over.  I put ampere in one of the little dresses.  I am pretty sure he didn't care for it. Kelly took to repeating "don't hurt the dress" over and over with a slight increases in volume every time.  Luckily for me, the dress was unharmed (save for some extra black hair).

I think the new girly baby clothes are as cute as the next guy, but I don't think this is helping in my plan to make my daughter extra ferocious.  So less frilly dresses and more shiny silk fightin' pj's.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Some time during the superbowl tom pointed out that I haven't made a movie since I started work at AMS.  Now this is a fact that I am well aware of, but this really made me think.  I really want to make another short, but I have to seriously decide what my priorities are and put my time and effort into them.  With the sad fact that I must earn a paycheck I know there is no way I can do everything I want.  Heck, with the way my job has been going I want to go do the work to earn a paycheck.  I really like my job, but it doesn't count on my list of activities and projects that I need to prioritize since it trumps those things with the gettin' paid part.

The main reason I haven't done any goofy film making is wushu.  I consider wushu a better investment of time than making a movie, so if I need to make the choice between the two then I needed to err on the side of training.  But with recent accomplishments I don't think I am going to be stepping up training.  Pan Am's are this summer, and I consider that to be the one last big tournament that I plan on really training for.  I may go to some more competitions yet, but now I am really looking into learning to judge and organize more than compete.

Ever since I was teaching TKD at VT I had been more interested in the coaching side of things.   Do crazy stuff like run a school, but not just any school I want the school that teaches all the insane stuff that I find interesting.  Not sure if there is anyone out there that wants to learn contemporary wushu, fight chorography, ground fighting and acrobatics but I would have loved to find a place that teaches that sort of thing.  Plus I have always dreamt of owning my own foam pit.

My list is getting skewed these days, and it is becoming blurry where the lines are -- I think the fact that the birth of my first child is quickly approaching.  Of course it also seems like she is taking her sweet time, because I am dieing to play with her.

A very short list of stuff I need to sift through and sort by importance (in no particular order):
Home Projects
-Back yard
-Back Patio
-Nursery
-Basement Bar

Fun Projects
-Geeky projects (WushuWiki, Cookbook, Etc)
-Video stuff (not movies)
-Movies (PDP)
-Photography
-Teaching at Wushu
-Judge Training

Spending time with my wife is always high priority, but the ironic thing is that is the first thing to get cut.  I always try to buffer in some time with her but it's like the coffee cup said: the most important things are the ones you take the most for granted.  I know there is overlap between certain activities, but in my head it don't count unless she thinks it counts.  And I am pretty sure she didn't think it counted as <i>spending time</i> when we were waxing our respective cars.

Sorry if this post is a little disjointed.  I wrote it in a very peace wise manner.  I started on it last week and on Friday I got the call from my Mom that my Nana passed away.  So we promptly rearranged out travel plans.  We were out there all week as opposed to this weekend like we had originally planned.  Work was very forgiving and allowed us to do whatever we needed.  I still worked a fair amount while I was gone, partly because I wanted to keep work happy so I can up and go away whenever I want with out them getting upset and party because I liked to work and concentrate on programming.  Things tended to get a little too sad when I didn't have something to keep me preoccupied.  I realize that I was fairly antisocial while I was there, but Kelly insists that was just fine given the circumstances.

Kelly said one of her friend at work was going to pray for the peaceful rest of my Nana.  I don't think she is resting; she did plenty of that in the hospital.  She is playing.  Some super fun games.

It has really emphasized the importance of family and helped to realign priorities. There were a few family related issues that the trip helped to workout, or at least bring back into my field of vision.  I tend to get caught up and not notice how important it is for me to do things like head down to Richmond and spend more time with those boys.

Nothing like loosing a family member when you are about to add a new one to slam you face first into some hardcore introflection.

I really need to go workout.  I am emotionally spent and I think that residual tension that needs to be purged.  Purged with tornado kicks.

It is supposed to snow this weekend, I think snowballs and a warm fire are exactly what Kelly, Leah and I could use.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Kelly got me these weird tuna lunch packs.  I really like them, it's a little tuna lunch kit -- with mayo, relish, tuna (surprise!), a little spoon and a much needed mint.  The problem with them is they are weird.  I have always been self conscious about eating tuna at work because that stuff has a tendency to stink up the place.  But now, when I am pealing the packet off the tuna, a can would be to normal, and squirting it out into the packaging I worry about my coworkers perception of the stinky guy. Yeah, the packaging doubles as a bowl.  It is sorta like an old GI Joe container, you peal the cardboard off the back and you have a little clear plastic rectangular 'bowl' to mix your tuna in.

I try to eat it early in the morning before anyone gets here.  I havn't yet gotten the curage or audacity to whip it out when there is anyone around.  Picture me eating this: After the bizarre dance of mixing the squeeze tuna in the GI Joe packaging, I glance around nervously hoping no one decides to walk over and say hi.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today I played with a bike bell over at sean and nina's place. It was the most fun ever.

<hr />

Take that Nina! Ha!

we did get to see those crazy guys after we went to church. They even took me home so I didn't have to leave when dumb kelly went to her dumb yoga. I got free CDs and books from their anti clutter pile. I have an offer for a foof. I want to take it. Kelly says no--citing some moratorium on bringing more stuff into the house. I am pretty sure I can spin it into some replacement for the old foof argument. Still, I see nothing wrong with 3 foof chairs. They are nicer to look at then gymnastic mats and I have been begging for one of those for a mere 7, 8 years now. (That is relevant because I consider a foof to be somewhat crash-mat like, thus sooths the burning desire for proper, blue, 8" gymnastics mats.

I revisited the unicycle again. This is one thing I want to figure out. My biggest obstacle is the fear of social backlash and mocking. anyone who can ride a unicycle is already a big dork, but the dork that has a unicycle that doesn't know how to ride it is a bigger dork still. I have but of an understanding of what it is to be a social outcast, and I think the normal assumption is that I clearly don't care about that sort of thing. But I am ashamed to admit it, I do.

Not that I am going to let it stop me from learning something as amazingly cool as riding a unicycle.

Really, who brags to their grand kids they their neighbours thought they were normal, nice people? I would much rather have fun stories of scooting around town on one wheel. And flipping. Oh, and springy shoes.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Who knew things could go so smootly.

The basement project at Ft. Truxion has met its final milestone.  No more 70's nasty wood paneling and yellow bar. Plus it is politely tucked away in the corner behind you as you enter the room, as if to say this room does not belong in a frat house.

We got some prefab cabinets form home depot, but as you can see the wall we decided to put the bar on has this nifty little bump out for the drain stack.  No big deal.  Or, at least that is what you think until you buy prefab cabinets and need place them against the wall with the bump out.  So Saturday Kelly's dad and brother came over to 1) bring me clamps and 2) clamp stuff.  We assessed the situation.  We built the cabinets ikea style.  We made mean faces at the bump out.

Eventually Rich and I decided this is going to be done right and we unfabbed the center 18" cabnet to straddle the bump out.  This is where things normally deteriorate into crumbling particle board and ripped out hardware, but this time was different.  The higher powers decided that they would smile upon us, everything went smoothly.  It was a barrage of clamping and sawing, sawing and clamping.  We cut out the grooves for that piece of masonite that slides in the back, we adjusted everything nicely and even located the quick connect hardware that they supplied.  In the end we had a nice inverted 'P' shaped cabnet (I guess that could be a lower case 'd' shape) that hugged the oddly shaped wall.  By the time rich left he was wondering around muttering to himself (and anyone else who would hear) how amazing this was.  I had to agree, there was no way that worked as well as it did. I didn't want to say anything.  I felt like we were looking at a shut out and I would jinx it if we said something.

Rich took off once the cabinet was done, but Neal-o hung around to help me with the countertop.  Which was a good thing due to the constant tango or prancing the 8' slab of particle board and laminate out to the patio for the clamps/saw and then marching it back in to check the most recent cut.  It wasn't until Sunday did I go and buy a wood/laminate specialty blade for my jigsaw.  Astounding how much different the blades can make.  Unfortunately I already made the cuts for the bump out and sidewall--which are exposed --with the regular wood blade.  However the sink cut out--covered by the sink--is super clean.  Ahh, I can cover them with a bit of quarter round and none will be the wiser.

Sunday was two trips to home depot, plumbing and the pretty details of the counter and cabinets (stuff like the laminate end caps, kick boards and doors).  Besides having to get creative with the drain the plumbing went smooth. I had a grand total of zero leaks in the feed lines.  I have a bit of a drip from the trap, but that is directly related to my aforementioned creativity.  One more trip to the h-d and I should be good.  I guess that answers my question about the j-trap being mounted backwards.  It truly does matter.

The other notable event of the weekend (a.k.a. the time I wasn't being bossed around by a pregnant lady in a foof*) was Luke's 1st birthday.  We showed up and Katie said there were a bunch of people there we would recognize.  First one I recognized was Sara Free.  I had no idea the Free Clan was going to be there, but they were--all 4 of them.  It's amazing how big the kids are.  We basically spent the evening hanging out with the college friends that we hadn't seen in way too long.  Todd and Marilee only live across the river, but we don’t see them nearly as much as we should. We hung out, played with some crazy hyper kids, ate cake, helped Luke open presents and watched the Muppet Show on Beej's giant TV.  By the end of the night we were falling asleep, but I wanted to stay as long as I could be because of the people there.

*Ok, so she did everything I asked and repeatedly offered to help, but that doesn’t make for a good story does it?]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[A lot of stuff has happened since I last posted.  I like to think that is why I havn't posted.

Last week started out with me being swamped at work trying to get ready for my trip to California for work.  We met with a couple of our big clients and I finally got to meet someone from our west coast office -- one of the guys I work with everyday.  Crazy how you get a picture in you head form their voice on the phone but when you see them they look nothing like that picture.  And now that I have seen him I cannot for the life of me remember what that original picture looks like, other than different.

There was nothing relaxing out the cali trip, we flew into the bay area really early our time, what would be a red eye for California, and arrived in time for a full day of meetings.  Driving through Oakland we saw one completely burned out van and a very fresh accident, complete with onlookers pouring out of their cars to try and help.  One guy was going to need the jaws of life to get out of his Olds.  Didn't look like any bad injuries though.

Once our day-o-meetings were over we promptly went to the airport to head to LAX.  Jumped in the car and headed to Santa Monica and checked into the hotel.  As my boss was finishing checking in he handed the lady the AmEx card and said to put my room on that one too.  He stood there while I did the check in process only to overhear that I had been given a free upgrade to an ocean view suite.

That night was when I got to meet the programmer extraordinaire from our San Diego office, we had some tasty seafood and crashed.  Hard.

The next morning I made the biggest mistake of the week.  I went running.  We decided to go jogging on the beach, maybe 3 or 4 miles total. But after a dozen steps my calves were protesting.  By the end of the jog it was hard to walk.  It would continue to be hard to walk for the next few days.

This made our second day-o-meetings super fun.  It also made for a pleasant time of running around the airport, sitting for 5 hours straight, and running around another airport.

Once back in VA I went home and actually struggled to get to sleep.  I think I was too tired to sleep.  So I wound up sleeping most of the day to wake up, quickly do a few things for work and head off to the rehearsal.

Rehearsal went well, there were a few things that proved annoying, but that was mostly due to people not listening to the people they should (IMHO) listen to.

Nikki's big day went well, with so much that could have gone wrong (isn't that true for all weddings?) the day ran pretty smoothly.  One of Anthony's brothers was being a jerk and had a temper tantrum over the color of his shirt (and apparently hair style), so I wound up blowing $50 on a couple of white shirts.  Apparently he cam close to getting punched in the face.  I didn't directly experience any of the drama, I was too busy rushing like crazy to get it to them in time. When I finally dropped them off everyone was chillin' in front of the TV.  Eh, they wound up being a mere only 25 min late, so no big deal.  Plus Nikki had a freezer she could stand in front of to stay cool.

The O-Club was nice. Would have been nicer to have the big room but that would have involved kicking out the bar mitzvah and inviting another couple hundred guests. Plus then we wouldn't get to check out all the cool army patches.  Food was good, Nikki was beautiful and Ant was romantical for her.

One side note: Thank God for Everett.  He saved the music for both the wedding and the rehearsal.  Playing live at the event-proper and DJing the reception.  My parents were able to supply a PA system, that Everett hooked his laptop up to and rocked the Italian/Yankee music that kept the crowd yelling "Hey" (no audible 'h' sound).  They loved NY-NY, and I was partial to Dominique the Italian Donkey.

Ev wound up crashing with us, and we crashed pretty hard.  We geeked out to scifi and slept a lot.

In closing:  Ampere likes to point uphill.  No matter how exciting things are behind him, he would rather face uphill than turn around.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[This was a very eventful morning. Lets recap:

But first we need some background so we know what's going on. I was the last person at work last night because I was trying to get, um, this odd task done. It was one of those things that isn't my normal work, but we needed someone to figure it out and send stuff to a client for brownie points. Basically it is a little embarrassing that we couldn't do it faster, and would be bad if it wasn't done. The process for finishing this task was much more annoying than was necessary. It involved 3 reboots, including windows refusing to restart because it had a task running, and I should cancel or wait for it to complete. I had already tried to wait and clicked cancel a few times, which is why I was trying to reboot in the first place. Eventually I got fed up and did a hard reboot only to get stuck with a 15 min boot time on the reboot. I tried to do the thing again, explorer hung again, I rebooted again, complete with the long boot. Eventually I got things working, but it was only step 1, step 2 required me to upload my stuff to another computer, but that had to wait. It said there were hundreds of minutes to go, so I left.

Oh, I tried to access it from home, but no luck, can't connect.

Ok, the recap:

<ul style="MARGIN-TOP: 0in" type="disc"><li>I struggled to get up. I think I was extra pathetic because Kelly allowed me to stay in bed till the last possible second. </li><li>I plugged the ipod into the computer to charge, but the computer went to sleep and the ipod stayed up all night so he was exhausted. A total of no battery left, won't even turn on, all I get is a sad battery icon and bloop, it's gone.</li><li>I had forgotten that Kelly had a doctor appointment, which wasn't till 10:30, so I was going to be late for work, which meant that my work-task was gonna have to wait. </li><li>Before the appointment K had to get her Glucose tolerance test, so we went to quest. Last time at quest we waited for a few hours before they finally took Kelly back and treated a total of two (2) arms as pin cushions, and then the nurse lied to me and said my wife had left me. I don't like them.</li><li>We got threre. We waited. I wanted to sleep. I discovered a comfortable position in my chair which involved pulling it out and leaning back. </li><li>Kelly got her orange-double-triple-sugar drink. And choked it down.</li><li>It upset her tummy a little</li><li>She felt a little light headed and told me to tell the nurse</li><li>I got up to tell them and before I could even get their attention the lady sitting next to Kelly announced that she had passed out. I turned around and sure enough, she her head had fallen back, her eyes were wide open (with and eery empty stare) and was otherwise unresponsive.</li><li>One lady insisted she was having seizures. </li><li>The nurses responded when I yelled louder at them.</li><li>We wheeled a dazed Mrs. Sexton back to a private room where she could lay down.</li><li>The nurse tried to call her doctor to see if we should finish the test, and treated this like it was a big deal. Her doctor responded by not answering the phone.</li><li>I ran upstairs to talk to the doctor. I think I actually spoke to a nurse practitioner, who pointed out that she prolly passed out because she probably hasn't eaten for a while and then tried to drink the sugar drink. I didn't point out that those were the directions we had received. </li><li>I returned downstairs and told the nurse that the doctors office gave the go ahead.</li><li>We waited.</li><li>Blood was drawn, the nurse hurt Kelly, it was better than last time, but still painful. More painful than a 'pinch'</li><li>We went to breakfast at the diner. K got pancakes.</li><li>After eating about half of them Kelly decided not to digest them and went and put them in the bathroom, along with a bunch of orange-sugar drink.</li><li>We told the nice people at the diner that they should go clean the bathroom.</li><li>At the doctors office they asked for a sample, but because of the aforementioned bathroom debacle she didn't have one left.</li><li>We waited.</li><li>They changed our due date twice this visit.</li><li>Still no sample and the pushy nurse made us wait till one magically appeared.</li><li>Eventually we got fed up and Kelly offered to take me to the metro.</li><li>We got stuck behind a stalled car, once the cops arrived they figured out how to work their car and drove away.</li><li>I arrived on the platform and they sign said orange and red lines were sharing a track. Expect delays.</li><li>I am now on the train, getting ready to run into the office 'round 1pm.</li></ul>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[It makes for a good weekend.  We even had couple of fun things happen

1) Dinner with wushu people.  When we ordered 4 ducks the waitress could hardly believe us.  She made a big deal about it, calling us crazy.  Then we decided to order 5 more dishes.  There was only 9 of us.  At one point Jason declared he had the meat sweats.  I think the duck carver-guy was cramping up at the end.  It was good to hang out with Paula this trip, since I hadn't had a chance to do that.  Also met some of Mario's friends, Emilio--of wushu message board fun--and his woman.  Wushu in the US is such a small community.  Lots of crazy conversation, Portuguese, Chinese, Spanish and English flying around -- no to mention the meat sweats.

2) DC with Everett and Sara.  Sara says E wasn't even gonna call, that she made him do it. So I felt justified in scolding him for not calling the other times he as come up to the city to hang out.  We had a good time wondering around.  Went to the spy museum, decided we didn't want to wait to get in or pay $30 a couple, so we headed to the tidal basin for some crowded cherry blossom fun.  Had ice cream at the old post office, and a fun dinner at FlatTop.

3) Productive lists with the wife. It's amazing how mush more we got done by sitting down, thinking of all those things we lie in bed thinking about, writing them on paper, and then deciding the priority of each.  We have a ton of stuff to do, some big, some small--but we also crossed few things off, and that makes me happy.

4) The first grilling of the season.  Just family for this one (but that was not from lack of effort). Oscar Myer Deli style hot dogs are really good, I think I like them better than Hebrew national.  The problem with HNs: they are too small or way too big, the OMDSs were just the right size, you can eat one before your burger and be happy.

I get free 5 guys for lunch.  I am very excited.  I hope I don't get the meat sweats.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Seeing a protest on TV is much different than experiencing one as it goes on around your workplace.

-Metro skills
--getting in the metro system
--getting off the escolator
--getting out of the metro system
--scooting over
---seat vigalante
--transfer train tricks
-How to protest
--Not wearing flags of other countries
--having remedial metro skills
--taco salad
Before I reflect on the protests around here I would like to take a moment and comment on what I have learned in my 6 months of daily metro commuting.

There are two basic metro skills that are required.

The most basic of which is how to get through the turnstiles/gates that every metro rider must go through when entering and exiting the system.  I realize it may not be the most straight forward process, but only because there are 2 types of cards. Metro tries to make this as obvious as possible.  The cardboard cards go in the slot.  They have a big arrow to show you how.  The slot is right there in the front. There is also a plastic RFID card that you must touch to the gate - there is a picture of the RFID card on the receiver so you can match.  Once you get past this you should be good.

Skill number the two: How to ride an escalator.  Yeah, there is "walk right, stand left," but that is a courtesy more than a skill.  The real skill is getting off.  When you get off an escalator you should resume walking and exit the general getting off the escalator area.  No matter what you see. You do not have to walk on the escalator, it does that for you. But when it is ends you must resume walking.  I recommend you resume in the same manner that you used to get on it in the first place.

I have developed my own tips and tricks.  Lets look at an example.  From my quiet observation I have figured out how to transfer trains that use the same platform.  This only works on same-platform transfers, which are extra tricky because when you must perform one of these conditions are probably less than ideal. I call this tip: Riding the blue line to Roslyn because the orange line is way too crowed to consider getting on.  Here's how it works:

• Ignore that crowed Orange line train, wait for the next blue line
• Board the blue line train when he arrives, enjoy sitting in your seat.
• When the train approaches Roslyn (the last transfer point to the orange line) try to be the last one off the train.
• Make sure you get off the car at the center door.
• Once you exit the train side step once and press up next to the train.
• Have fun getting shoved as people crowd around you when boarding (this is a necessary evil)
• As the train leaves don't move in any direction more than one step.
• When the Orange line arrives you should be situated right next to a middle of the car door, this is good, more people can board in the middle doors (as you get on half go right, half go left and you meet the people form the end doors and stop).
• Enjoy your slightly less crowded ride.

There are certain courtesies that really need to be in place in a civilized mass transit system.  Many people overlook these and instead revert a selfish approach.  The best way to test a person would be the seat-scoot.   When you are riding on the outer seat and the person next to you vacates their seat you are allowed to retain a seat, but should scoot over to the inside seat.  There are exceptions to this rule, such as if there are no standing riders, but for the most part the lack of scoot would be akin to shouting "I'm a big fat selfish jerk" real loud.

As a person who commonly watches as completely capable fully grown men refuse to scoot, I see the need for seat vigilantes.  The attack of the seat vigilante is simple: If you won't scoot over the SV will come over and ask to sit next to you.  SV's will eagerly ignore any other open seats (I'm assuming the other standing people would like them, and they don’t want to deal with the anti-scoot-jerk) .  Climb over you and spread out comfortably.

You can't become a seat vigilante and just go around haphazardly sitting, one must carefully observe the situation and determine if someone needs to be taught a lesson.  Possible exceptions would be people with lots of luggage or someone in a full body cast.

Protests.

I have no political leanings on the immigration policies that were being protested.

With that said]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I got head to toe on my left leg last night.  I was surprised at first, and that sorte melted away into this smug pleased with myself feeling.  But that was shatered like a dinner plate when a contact juggling ball has been droped on it when I realized that everyone else could really care less. I have also realized a head to toe streatch is only a minor milestone on the way to kicking your self in the head.

If tip-toe not touch fore of head, no points shall be awarded.]]></content:encoded>

<title>Easter was the proper end for the crazy week.</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[We went to the 'dorf for Easter.  Had some good family time out there.  GSPC service was good, and it was a blast hanging back watching the round wife make the rounds. All these people who knew her growing up, and the exclamations of "oh my, look at the belly!"  I liked sneaking downstairs for the free goldfish and coffee.

Last week was a cyclone of craziness.  We had a few people out on vacation so I was trying to fill in for them and do my normal thing.  My normal thing was pretty full for the week to start with, so I was swamped.  The beginning of the week was intense, but by Thursday I was loosing focus.  Still got what I needed to get done, but wasn't cranking through as fast as I was at the beginning of the week.  Workin' fatigue.

Hopefully I can get some decent training in this week, I wasn't too bad last week, especially if you count the lifting.  But I am not used to the light schedule.  Stephan complained that he doesn’t have a training buddy anymore now that I am never there.  Well, I think I make it 3 days a week, which to us is barely training at all.  I told him things are unlikely to improve as the year goes on.  Maybe in 5 years when Leah can go too.

I played around on MySpace and Flikr a little.  Mostly to see what all the fuss was about.  I have decided that flikr is kinda neat, and myspace is annoying.  Oh and youtube is fun when people give you positive feedback.  [Go rate and comment]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YStVoZN9hNk)!]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I'll see everyone at Lamaze.  Don't worry we have a blanket and two pillows in the car.

I like podcasts.  The only problem is sifting through the crappy ones, but then you find something fun like the awesome giants one or the hyper active podrunner.  However I won't admit to listening to the MacCast one.  That would just be too much.

Oh, and [this]( http://www.redbullflugtagusa.com/) is my idea of fun.  However I was told to be discrete so I won't go into detail.

In closing I will leave you with a picture of our lake.  I went with Kelly on one of her walks around the lake.  Besides slowing her down and making it a less viable means of exercise I was able experiment with the camera.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Kelly and I really didn't get out much this past weekend.

There was some wushu hijinks on Friday, where I was the only non-asian (possabily the only non-Chinese), and everyone's elder by a dozen years or so.  Kelly hung around and watched class/talked with the parents.  I had a great time training, I pushed pretty hard, and heckled the kids when they were slacking off.  I was feeling old until I overheard Colvin commenting on my jumps.  I felt cool until I realized that I around more middle and high school aged kids than post college people.  Ok, not really 'around' so much as 'friends with'.  Which might be normal for, say, a high school teacher, but no so much a corporate drone.

We worked on the nursery.  I hauled a bunch of stuff up into the attic, through that tiny, tiny hole in the back of the closet.  We wanted to make more convenient access in the hallway, but I am not sure I can work around the ductwork that is up there, nor do I think I really want to put the level of effort into making it happen.  So, in the mean time I shoved all the boxes that would fit up there, along with a bunch of old college notes and stacked them on some shelving I laid across the rafters.  I was up and down an awkwardly placed ladder, squeezing through a hole which was less wide than my shoulders, trying to carry heavy boxes full of papers.  Neat!
K helped clear out a bunch of stuff deemed trash.  Gathered a few things for the church yard sale and were done for the weekend.  I still have a couple of old office chairs and computer desks that need to get gone, but the room is slowly becoming emptier.  Another weekend of leisurely work and it will be ready for painting.  Of course I could buckle down and just get it empty, wainscoted and primed in a weekend.  If I wanted to.

Sunday we bought a glider from some Italians.  When we left their little boy said "ciao" and "bye bye chair" which was cuter than puppies.

I did a demo at Mason, for the Asian Heritage month or some such, went pretty well.  The highlight of the demo was smoothies at Smoothie King.  He really is the king of smoothies.  And a much less creepy than the burger king.  That guy weirds me out.

Kelly made dinner, some Carolina rubbed pork chops.  Oh, and I ate a huge back of raisinettes.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[On our way to drop me off at the metro this morning Kelly and I saw a something very disturbing.  We saw a man hit a bright yellow Porsche.  It was totally the Porsche's fault, he turned when the other guy had the light.  There was no damage done to the yellow car, but Mr. Porsche Driver seemed really pissed, was flailing his hands all around and looked like he was yelling.  Very bizarre.

Oh, and the guy that hit him was walking. He had a WALK light.  Not even a flashing hand.  After witnessing it, I turned to the wife and ask her if he was mad for attempting to run over some pedestrians.  She confirmed it did appear that way.

Promptly after that, right after I boarded the metro a lady was trying to get on and the door closed right on her.  So she pulled back but her lunch was caught in the door.  A few of us jumped up and tried to pry the door open for her, her hand was tangled in the plastic supermarket bag.  We couldn't push the door open wide enough to get the Tupperware outside of the train, and she didn't seem to be able to get her hand out.  Eventually someone pushed the intercom and told the driver to open the door.  It jerked open about 8" and slammed shut.  Luckily she was able to get her stuff unharmed.  I understand if doors are closing, they are closing, so don’t try and get on.  But c'mon, we shouldn’t have to wrestle with the door for two or three minutes before you break down and let her go.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Nikki graduated this weekend, so we went down to Radford. Kelly, the 'rents and I headed down the night before and hit up the Homeplace for some proper south western cookin' and all the gluttony involved with that.  Headed back to the hotel and crashed.  The next morning after an air raid and the ensuing rolling blackouts we stopped into Shoney's for some breakfast bar and made our way to the Radford campus.  Upon our arrival we heard the world's most accomplished Radford graduate speak to the graduating class.  And by accomplished I mean egotistical and conceited. Once the university commencement finished Nik's college did their thing and we watched everyone walk up and get a fake diploma roll.  The four of us watching from the crowd all got nice and crispy from the sun, and soon realized that sunscreen wasn't the only thing we forgot.  Apparently we needed air horns, big sombreros and flowers.  How unprepared we felt.

After the formal fun we headed to Macados in Blacksburg for some celebratory eating.  Nikki figured the one in Radford would be crowded so we might as well go to Blacksburg.  Kelly and I didn't protest.  Kelly got a stogie, I got Dietrich's Delight -- and we chased our tasty sammiches with a macawitch.  Unfortunately this otherwise super-awesome time was interrupted with a reminder that I went to Shoney's for breakfast.  I had Shoney's whammy.  It wasn't too bad at Macados, but I could tell it was coming.

We said good bye to the graduate, and headed to the campus.  We just made a b-line for the bookstore to get some little presents for Leah. I think we dropped $14 on two pairs of baby socks.  We didn't know we were gonna spend that much on such a little product until we were checking out, but I don’t' think it would of mattered much.

It was about this time when the Shoney's whammy really hit, I asked the girl where the nearest bathroom was and she said Donaldson Brown or the library, I opted for the library because I knew where the restroom was in there. I had on one of those belts that was made out of nylon webbing or somesuch marterial with it's friction closure.  No normal belt buckle.  Normally this is just fine, but when panic sets in the operation of said belt becomes logarithmically more difficult.  Things became very urgent at the end, as I was standing in an open stall (if you are truly panic'd you realize there is no time to shut the door, much less put the seat down) digging frantically and saying swears at my belt but luck would have it I made it (seat down and door shut) in the nick of time.  That was way to close.

I was able to wander out of the library and find my wife lounging on the drillfield.  We reluctantly returned to the car and headed back to Richmond.

That night we hung out with Ev and Sara, went to the original bottom's up pizza -- which was much better than I remember it being.  Tasty bbq chicken pizza.

Sunday we saw my sister and her boys, while crazy at times, was a good thing.  The boys spent a good long time climbing on me and wanted to roughhouse all after noon.  Eventually they got worn down, which was long after I had been worn down, and we could play board games and video games.  I even got to talk to Laura and Matt for a while before we headed to grandma's house for dinner.

Revisiting our bathroom-style-talk:

Jacob ran off to the bathroom and when he was returning to the room this conversation took place:
Kelly: Jacob, did you flush and wash your hands?
Jacob: No, I never wash my hands.
Chris: Jacob, can you not ever touch me again?

We wound up staying at grandmas longer that we expected, which wasn't too bad.  Then we got stuck in traffic for 70 miles, which was too bad. The Furry monsters were just fine and showed us their bellies, which we rubbed.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I know I have been slacking, but I would refer you to the Technicolor flem coat that my sinuses were sporting in the latter half of last week.  It was when we went to our last Lamaze class on Wednesday that I noticed I was feeling less than good. Thursday I went in late--mostly because we were having a company lunch for one of my coworkers who is going to be MIA for a while--but got sent home early, probably due to my cheery disposition.  Friday was just as bad and I just worked from home.  It wasn't much work, but I was doin' stuff.  Most of the not work was verizon's fault. Stupid DSL*.

That night we went to Laura's red belt test (her school is brown-red-black), Todd and Marilee even came down from the land God shuns.  We tried fro Italian, but the wait was too long so we opted for the immediate Chinese food.  Laura even insisted that I sit next to her *grin*, the real trick was convincing Luke to like you.  That is one cute baby.  Biggest surprise was the gungpaoji at hunan west was actually good, and the time when Kelly and I got it we didn't get it at all.  I blame that ABC girl who couldn't understand my Chinese.

We had to head home after dinner, despite the tempting invite to hang at the power's place, but we had a couple of good reasons.  1) We were sick (did I mention that I got Kelly sick too?  Poor preggers) and 2) I had to do a demo at Junior Team Trials the next morning.  So we bailed.  I took Afrin for the first time in I don't know how long and slept.

Up early, grabbed my stuff and hit McDonalds on the way to UMD.  I got a large coffee which was way too hot to drink and a bacon and egg biscuit which I put in my bag and forgot about.  Luckily the place was easy to find--actually the venu was perfect for the tournament, it was just the right size for one carpet.  I was impressed with Justin's abilities to run the tournament at this point.  We set up the music and warmed up with the competitors.  Aside from the music for the Star Spangled Banner kicking in at the beginning of the a capella rendition of America the beautiful everything went pretty smoothly.  I wasn't really happy with the changquan, but that was mostly because I tried to change things at the last second and wound up going the wrong way a couple of times.  I think I covered it pretty well, but that really takes away from the quality of the form.  Our duilan felt pretty good.  The music seemed to match up fairly well, so overall I was happy.

Our kids did really well, I only stayed for the bare hand but when I left Kat was sitting pretty with the highest score of the day, Tenya and Jen were 2 and 3 I think.  Not to be completely undone Colvin was leading boy's group b. It smelt like burnt carpet when he was done. Jon tore up the nanquan in what may have been his best form ever.

Kelly was really good and only called once or twice, but I knew she was home alone and wasn't feeling too great so after we got lunch (and introduced Neal to bubble tea) I bugged out.  We were supposed to go over to Sarah's house and hang with a bunch of wushu people that night, but just didn't feel up to it so we stayed home and rested with the cast of scrubs.

Sunday, AKA Mother's Day, we had the Tulli over and made them a tasty meal.  They declared they like coming over for eating because it requires little effort on their part.  Any chance to dust off ole grillie.  Now that I think about it I believe I have some left over tenderloin in the fridge that I should have brought with me today.  If you are gonna eat leftovers it's best to make sure it is Jamaican jerk grilled tenderloin.

Of course while we were having this fun, the kids were still competing.  I didn't get the report beck from Stephon till late that night but we rocked the tournament, the past months and months of full sets paid off for them.  Congrats to everyone who made the team.

Yesterday the nursery became less of a room.  The glory of the orange and maroon was short lived, but this is a necessary setback, as Leah requires proper quarters.  Now I need to go borrow a miter saw.  Hey BEEJ!

* I would like it to be know that I tried to call them back and cancel the house call that I have for today, but 15 minutes of listening to the recording say it will be less than five minutes is more than any good customer should have to take.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[We spent some real time working on the nursery.  I think the room is going to look really nice when we are done, our little girl should feel like her parents love her.  Heck I think it would look really nice if we would tack up the chair rail and be done with it.   So far we have primed over the orange and maroon, painted the bottom of the walls white, the top and ceiling blue, and the trim baby Leah pink.  I would like it noted that I nearly had to insist on the pink.  Heck, I like the idea of a baby girl's room being pink.  The stuff I am refusing is the "princess" thing.  Mostly because I fear if you allow princess you open the gate to "diva" and then "spoiled brat" and that is a slippery slope to no good land.

In addition to the nursery I got Kelly a dishwasher.  It was her first official mother's day present from me. A dishwasher.  I think that sets the tone.

since it was tiled in I had to yank up the counter to remove the old one.  But I couldn't get the hot water valve to completely shut off so I decided I shouldn't disconnect it until we get the new one.  So off to sears.  Stupid sears makes us pick it up from the warehouse in dulles.  Lowes and Homedepot offer free delivery. We were annoyed, but you can only get Kenmore at sears and Kelly preferred Kenmore (plus it is a nice dishwasher), so our kitchen is a splode and I gotta leave work early to drive out to Dulles.  Oh, and then go home and swear until it is installed.

Helped Mario move on Saturday, and Kelly had her lactation class.  Yep, excitement abounds.

I was supposed to go to Coach's birthday dinner Sunday, but didn't found out what time it was until it was starting.  And it was in Chantilly, so that ruled that out.  I am beginning to suspect someone didn't want me to go.  Hrmmm...

And now...pictures of my cats! Why do I take so many pictures of my cats?

<title>Dishwashers are not worth it.</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I had to leave work 2 hours early because stupid sears' customer pickup is just a little north of Dulles.  Luckily I rolled up in plenty of time to get our shiny new dishwasher loaded in the truck and had the opportunity to bask in the hordes of traffic on my way back to Burke.  Just to mix things up I turned on Old Centreville Rd not New Braddock Rd.  They don't connect. I got home and manhandled our new appliance into the kitchen.  The cats were up on top of the box before I even got it all the way into the kitchen.  I rummaged around for the tools I thought I would need, and cut the box open.  The dishwasher looked correct and good, so that was happy.  The old one was relatively easy to remove, at least for a dishwasher that has been tiled in.  Normally I don't think that is a big deal, but our 1.5" think terracotta tile is pretty big, so it was problematic.  The only real problem, aside form ripping up the counter, was disconnecting the electrical wireing.  I really could of just cut it and been just fine, but something told me I should conserve every inch of that wire.  That something was pretty dumb, and I should have just cut it.  I had extra wire getting in the way.

This was the point that I had only real annoyance.  I was able to unhook the water feed line just fine, but I couldn’t remove the L that connected the feed line to the dishwasher.  I wastled it for some time before my efforts resulted in destroying the little copper piece and I headed out to get a enw one.  I figured I sould try walmart first, but no luck, so I headed up to Home Depot and proceeded to buy the wrong piece.  Luckily I did find a dishwasher kit with the part I did need, along with lots of extra parts I didn't need.  The $16 was a bit more than the $2 for the single part, but way better than a second trip out there.

The new dishwasher's hookups were all in roughly the same place as the old one, so all the existing hardware was usable, however the new one had a solid support along the side that blocked side access to where the water feed needed to go.  Because of this I had to slide the dishwasher under the counter as far enough to reach the line, but out far enough that I could tip it up and still access everything to tighten everything down.  With some swearing and crescent wrench acrobatics everything got screwed down.  I had the wife s-l-o-w-l-y turn on the water and I watched as it slowly dripped.  So I tightened it a quarter turn, wiped it down and it dripped again.  I repeated.  A few times.  Eventually the drips got slower.  I thought it was about as tight as it would go and it still leaked, so I did what any good plumber would do, cranked it down hard.  That seemed to work.

I ate the dinner Kelly procured.  Went back and checked, we were good.  So we ran a few dishes through.  No obvious puddles.  Rock on.  A mere 6 hours of work.

Sears charges $60 for delivery, but installation is free.  What a freakin' good deal.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last week: Gymnastics class and a wushu demo.

I finally went back to gymnastics last week. Dr. Vyvy and Dr. Emily both showed up and we were determined to remember some of this skills that we were sure we had long forgotten.  I was able to get roundoff-back tuck (and layout)--it was one of those "like riding a bike" things, but I am a pansy and it took me a few hundred roundoff punches to do it.  It was cool catching with Carlos and telling him about worlds, and telling him about Leah. Which is relevant since his daughter is 5 now, so he knows where I am coming from.

That was Tuesday.  On Thursday we had a demo in DC for some committee of the Mayor.  It was fun, there were TV cameras and we were allowed to carry our weapons through the metal detectors at Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Library downtown.  It was a small demo, just four of us, which came back to haunt me.  After basics during jumps, on the first tornado kick I landed funny and felt a sharp pain in my calf.  I was able to walk, albeit painfully, so I continued the demo.  Prolly a stupid thing to do, but I didn't want to explain everyone why I did basics and 2 jumps and decided to stop.  So I pushed through.  Luckily Stephon drove me home and I didn't have to walk back to the metro.  I skipped class that night and the Friday.

Saturday we had testing.  I was a judge, so a jacked calf was no problem.  Kids did well, Nan and Jen were judges with me.  We got free lunch.  Everyone wins!

Since this was memorial weekend we had an extra long, um, weekend.  This meant that we could do extra work on the nursery.  We actually made huge gains on that little room.  I got the Wayne's coating (which Beej tells me is more like shadow boxes than Wayne's coating) all cut, painted and nailed to the wall.  The base pain (i.e. everything except the mural) is done and look great.  We could use a little more touch up on the trim, but I am really happy with everything.  Once we finished stage one I really could have stopped and been very happy with the room.  Already it was nicer than any other room in the house.  But I am determined to at least try to get the mural up, so work continued.

Yesterday, memorial day proper, I was able to get the background fill in for the mural.  Thanks in part to a sa-weet old school overhead projector that The Tulli acquired for us.  Then last night, sometime after 11 pm I started on the outline of our little animals.  I was going to paint the black with a 1" brush I picked up at home depot, but there is no way that would have worked.  So we ran out ot target and I picked up a pack of 5 back-to-school special paint brushes.  I used the smallest one in the pack.  It was perfect.

I have a few more decisions to make on the mural, like should I fill in the penguin?  And I got to get the kites up…but my concerns have been put to rest, cause it is coming along pretty nicely.

Oh, don't worry we had the obligatory grillin' yesterday.  It's true, you are communist if you do no sear meat over fire on memorial day.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I got hit on this morning when I went to get coffee.  At least I think I did.

Here is what happened, you determine for your self:

After I paid I heard the girl say to her co-worker (girl 2) that she gets this one and that the other girl 2 can have that one.  I assumed it was about the two guys in suits.  Girls like guys in suits.  Girl 2 looks at me and smiles with a "she is nuts" type of look. I figure that confirms that she was talking about he guys in the suits.

But, as I am fixing my coffee she comes over and asks for my "John Hancock" on the credit card receipt.  I oblige.  Now the tricky part.  She complements my legs:
Her: You must work out ALOT! (yes, way too excited)
Me: Yeah, I do.
Her: Cause your calves are really nice.
Me: Uh, thanks.
Her: I mean, they are all like...(sound effects)...you can really see the definition.
Me: Well, hey, I appreciate it.
Her: Of course!  Have a great day!

So, maybe a polite complement, but I am 30 minus 2, so as far as I am concerned I got hit on. Even if it was a way-to-chipper coffee house girl.

Crap, now my VT hat won't fit.]]></content:encoded>

You know, I've been taking advanced classes and I was completely overwhelmed with how ultra-good the advanced students are when I did my first session Wednesday last week. Last Saturday's 2 hour-session was tiring but very fun (Sifu made it interesting, she is indeed a very great teacher/coach!) Put my name (and link) on your "Others" section =)]]></wp:comment_content>

I need a better picture, I used the flash since I didn't have decent lighting or a tripod and the colors are wack.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Kelly had two showers this weekend, and she got loaded down with baby supplies and accessories.  The weeks leading up I was beginning to get very frustrated at all the girls that were bailing on her.  Some people had valid excuses, but there seemed to be plenty of questionable ones.  However when I thought about it I realized this is an awkward situation since a shower is really just an excuse to ask for presents. So if I get annoyed that someone doesn't come it is like I get mad about not getting presents just cause I asked for them.  I should (and hopefully don't) have that sort of entitlement.  Really I just wanted people to come out and celebrate the arrival of this poor little girl that is going to be forced into my care.

Maybe I was worried tha tnoone would show up and Kelly would be sad, but since that didn't happen all is good.  She had two wonderful showers.  The first one was a little tireing for her since  they lacked a person to keep her in line (by making a big fuss if she tried to do anything) but she had a good time.  The Sunday shower was the curch shower in waldorf, and it was fancy (or so I hear) with fancy cakes, fancy decorations, and fancy seating charts. Fancy.

While she was busy doing her thing I got to (on Saturday) take the nephews to the movies and (on Sunday) hang out with the grandpas and eat 5 guys.  It was clearly better than playing games that involved eating baby food.

Keeping with this baby theme we have going on, we have been interviewing nannies.  Well, not the kind that come to your house, but for daycare that is out of the provider's home.  And saying providers or daycare people sounds odd, so I am going with nanny.  But we have been on a interviewing streak, something like 5 or 6 of 'em.  I think we have some ladies that we like, but this is hard.  Finding a person that you are going to entrust the life of your helpless little child.  Interviewing is an interesting experience, mostly because for their English skills and trying to explain things like "self sooth" to these ladies ("What? You want your baby to cry?").  But I think we are going to be happier with the in(their)home care than a big institution, if anything for the flexibility it will have.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[In the car ride into work this morning I was talking to kelly.  Here is a breif exerpt of our conversation:

Me: Kelly, are you a weeble-wobble?
Her: No, I fall down.
Me: So your a weeble-thud?
Her: Yes.

I have conversations like this all the time, yet Kelly is still nice to me.  I have no clue why.  But we did decide if we need to get weeble-wobbles for Leah we can just talk to Aimee.

Oh, and from Jiayo:

"U.S.A is great also. Especially when Stephon Morton and Chris Sexton is representing." --batman

Clearly the Dark Knight dosen't know what he is talking about, but it sure made my day.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Kelly tells me I qualify as a father now (and I believe the things she tells me), so I was able to celebrate Father's Day yesterday.  We had my parents and littlest sister come up and we did a little grillin and chillin.  I was able to impress the parents with Leah's room and some tasty port tenderloin.  Of course Kelly did all the real work on the tenderloin all I did was make it hot.

In the end I made out with a sweet table saw, which is still in its box in the kitchen.  The cats seem to think it makes a sweet perch. Everyone wins!]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Mama is making progress, the doc is still saying any day now.  Still 100% effaced and now 3 cm dilated. She said she was surprised Kelly hasn't gone into labor.

I keep getting asked if I am nervous. While that may be part of it I am mostly ancy at this point.  The labor is a little disconcerting, but the doctors keep saying that since Kelly has progressed so far already that it should be an easier labor.

Wushu is getting the shaft recently, which is expected given the situation.  However I still have to go compete at Pan Ams here in a month, and I have this strong desire to, lets say, not embarrass my country.  Honestly the injuries are holding me back more than  anything.  Nothing big, but a bunch of little annoying stuff.  I pulled my calf at the demo a few weeks back and it still acts up, not very painful, but enough to remind me that I should shouldn't attempt aerials until it is better.  Monday I did something to my knee in the mabu after a jump outside.  It was strange, no distinct pain or pop, but it was not 'right.' I skipped the next couple of jumps and came back for some reluctant butterflies, which seemed to go ok.  When I attempted to walk though my form there was a bit of pain in the joint.  Since knee injuries scare me proper I stopped.  Coach said I had too much on my mind these days and reminded me to take care of Kelly--which was good because after that I wanted to bail on class early.

I need to hurry up and get to work, the USA game starts soon and all the workers are going to wonder 'round till we find some place we can watch it.  I really hope somewhere is open and will allow us to watch with out a $20/hour spending requirement. We went to Shelly's for the first game and that was pretty sweet, but the game was a lunchtime, so a sammich was plenty to keep the joint happy.  It's a little harder at 10 am.  Especially if the only place open is the ESPN zone, they are pretty much big ole jerks when it comes to the required spending limits.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Got balloons stuck in hard to reach places?  Agile cat willing to chew them free.  Give Ampere a call for a free quote.

<hr />

I know it has been a while, so I guess I need to give the nothing, or should I say no one, yet.  Kelly is ready to pop, the doc agrees, but Leah is pretty chill with her situation.  So we are waiting on her.

Who's idea it was to leave this decision up to a 0-year-old?

Kelly is still doing really well.  I think she is a better at 9-months than a lot of the women I have seen at 7-months.  Plus she goes out of her way to not 'be one of those annoying pregnant women.' I think it kinda takes the fun out of it.  She is prolly saving all the fun for Leah.

In other news:

Yesterday at work I got programmatic proof that I could do what I needed to do.  It was one of those projects that you don’t know if you can actually do it until it is completely working.  Like learning a butterfly twist, there is no way to build up to it--just gotta go for it and pray.  Well, my code works--I'm not sure how, must be magic--but it works, so I am a happy guy there.

DC has gotten a buttload of rain this past week, so much that the metro had flooded.  It only seemed to affect the orange and the blue lines, which, lucky for me, are the two I can take to get to work.  Monday the commute was nasty.  Aside from the metro flooding there was the washed out bridge on guinea and all the road repair on prosperity.  When my train finally got into the district and we sat with the doors open at Foggy Bottom for 10 minutes, I decided I should just make the hike. Which wasn't too bad, just ridiculously humid, allowing me to be the sweaty guy at work.  Yay that guy.

I worked from home on Tuesday, which was a good thing since that was the day all the federal buildings flooded--as well as the basement of our building.  Wednesday I made it to Farragut West before I got fed up and decided to walk.  That day was not so humid, and the walk was damn near pleasant.

Wushu has been slow.  With my sprained knee I am very skittish about what I can train.  I keep discovering different thing I should not do.  It only hurts when I twist it -- I can walk with out pain.  Heck I can lift with out pain, I just can’t do wushu.  T minus 20 days until I have to compete.  DAngit, it was supposed to be hard to train because I have a brand new baby, not because I have a baby AND I am injured.  Twice, lets not forget the calf.  (Frick you getting older!)]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/leah/image/595/Leah.jpg" >

Leah Marie Sexton is here!

7lbs 6oz, 19 1/2"  Delivered by c-section at 10:58 p.m. on July 1st.
(Two more minutes and I would of won the pool!)

Both Kelly and Leah are doing well.

This being such a monumental event in my life I have tons of things to say, but I don't think I am going to get to most of them here today.

I have gotten over the initial exhaustion, that 2 hours a sleep (non contiguous ) a day was tuff.  Kelly handled it much better than I did, and traditionally she is much worse when functioning sleep deprived. I think I did a great job keeping my head when dealing with kelly and the baby, but noticed I was a getting short with other people.

We got home from the hospital wednesday around 4.  I have to point out that I remember seeing the other fathers leading up their new babies into the car to go home and how lucky and excited they must have been.  I had no idea how terrifying it was going to be -- because once you leave you are on your own. Just one of the many unexpected emotions of this past week.

Kelly's mom was over for much of the week helping out, and we have had a couple of people stop by and bring us food and hang out for a while.  A very welcome couple of things.  Food for the hunger and some company to ward off the cabin fever.

I had no idea how trivial my daughter would make the rest of my life seem.  I have the last big competition coming up in about a week, but that just seems silly at this point.  I am gonna try and train some this week so I can go and make her proud, but it is going to be hard. I knew I would be excited and would love her, but the actual experience is so much different that what I had thought it was going to be -- much more intense.

Agh, I am scatter brained enough right now, I am gonna go and leave you with a few pictures.  Because this proud dad likes to show off his beautiful little girl.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Leah's Grandpappy's (aka Peepaw) vision of the Washington Post on July 1st:

<img src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/leah/image/595/Leahs_Press_Release.jpg" class="picture">

Fatherhood continues upon its bizarre course to lands that Leah rules and Henry surveys.  Amp and Kelly are there as well, but like me have very little input into how things are done.

Life has been full of family recently.  We have had many visitors, some from far-off lands, lots of close friends and family.  Now that the barrage is over and we can look back on it I have decided it was really nice.  I like my friends and family.

Not the least of which is the wushu family.  I felt at home on Tuesday when I walked into O-Mei and was met with a few gasps followed by a round of applause.  Oh, wushu jia, you guys are great.  I really want to bring the baby in to meet everyone, but that place is sweaty and dirty -- so you guys are welcome to come and meet her at home.  I just ask you call first (and wash you hands if you are coming from the school).

Pan Am's is in a week.  I am so not prepared.  I think I am putting the lion's share of effort into sword.  I feel I can coast on my changquan, and spear is just hopeless--so sword it is.  That and duilian, assuming Stephon actually makes it up to Canada (c'mon, there's prize money in that event!). Leah really makes competing in wushu feel so silly, but I dumped a bunch of cash at it already--so here goes.

Today is my first day back at work, and I am finding it hard to concentrate on work. I keep thinking 'bout my ladies at home.  Wondering how they are doing, if they need anything.  Of course I could be finding it hard to concentrate because I had a large coffee and about 4.5 hours of sleep.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[The lactation consultant referred us to a suck evaluator.  Yes, those are their job titles.  No, I could not make that up.

Babies are funny -- so are the titles of the people that help you with them.

In other news, T minus 3 days before panams.  I am feeling pretty good, out of shape and way out of pratice, but pretty good. I think it was when Lucas grumbled something about our forms looking the same (back in the ye ole days of or prime).  So that made me feel a little better.

My knee held up pretty good, I was nervous as hell all through class and was super careful -- but I did all my nandu and everything seemed to be a-ok.  I noticed it was a bit sore today, so will continue on my cautious approach, but hopefully everything will hold up through competition.

I don't think I want to abandon Leah and Kelly for that long so I think they have to come along.  Must smuggle baby.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I am back home, and back with my women.  I returned home to find them in good shape, and happy to see me.  I need to readjust to the sleep schedule, which the after party and all the traveling threw way out of whack.  Baby girl seems to have a supernatural ability to wake up when we set her down in the bassinette.

Let me give a quick pan am update.  The tournament went really well.  I had the public goal of bringing home a medal, and I brought home two.  Secretly I really wanted to get gold, I tried to convince myself that any medal would do, but I couldn't do it.  I wanted a gold--I feel egotistical admitting it, but it is true. I figured I had one chance and that was in jianshu, but I wound up with a silver (which was bittersweet as there was a tie for gold, making me 3rd in the event).  Qiang was the only event left, my worst event.  I tried to convince Stephon to come to duilan but no luck, so I decided I was happy with my medal and I would try to have as much fun as possible in spear. By the time I went there was a 3 way tie for gold everyone at 9.3.  So while I was waiting for my score I was hoping for a 9.3, figuring it would be a stretch.  Then it popped up, 9.4. All I could think was "no way."   You would think I would be really relieved at that, but I didn't believe it--it still hasn't sunk in.  Needless to say I was really happy, even with out duilan (which was supposed to be my best shot).

While I had high hopes for jianshu my form was not my best.  I had two big brain farts. The biggest one was in section three where I stood up facing the wrong direction.  I just stood there, wondering who turned the room around and how I was going to fix things and go in the right direction.  My internal monologue was quite active at the time, involving many less-than-polite words.  The other big things was the second to last movement, I did something, realized that wasn't in my form, was at a loss with what to do next so I did it again.  My teammates said they didn’t notice the mistakes, but stuff like that throws you off and the rest of the form is defiantly not going to be as good as it could. Luckily I didn't drop my weapon on any of the tosses or any of the other nightmare situations I had dreamt up while preparing.

Changquan was pretty normal except for a bobble on my tornado.  ZFJ360, c'mon!  A bobble on a 360, really?  Oh well.  In the end I did well enough to get a certificate. Sure, Colvin beat me, but he was on fire.  I was very happy with the results, but not quite pleased with my performance.

While I was there I didn't have very much down time, but when I did I spent most of it thinking about the women back home.  I had a good time seeing old friends and telling them the good news, and like any other proud dad I was showing off pictures.  Part of the reason I had little down time was due to the fact that I was appointed as team captain  Sure it sounds cool, but in reality  it is just a bunch of responsibility I didn't ask for.  I guess in the end most of the stuff is stuff I would have done anyway, but now I had to do it.

Now I am at work and must make up for lost time.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I have been making collages and other framed pictures of Leah, when I started she Kelly was feeding her.  Then we moved her to the pack-n-play, Kelly went up stairs for some way overdue sleep and I continued printing-n-framing.  Eventually Leah decided she didn't like begin alone and decided I should hold her.

I gave her a little bit of a bottle, but since then she as been zonked out on my lap.  I just finished putting together my pictures, Kelly is still upstairs sleeping, and I am a happy man.

Kelly had a latter half of a day yesterday, and the night to match.  She had a fever, and all the muscle soreness that goes along with it.  When I overheard her telling leah that this is a bad as after surgery I decided I really don't like it.  Hopefully I can trick her into sleeping for multiple hours, because if she was left to it on her own she would concentrate on Leah and ignoring all of her discomfort.

She is amazing, doesn't get frustrated or tired nearly as fast as I do.  Of course there are limits, but those don't appear until complete exhaustion has set in.

Correct answer: Amazing.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last night we had our annual Ode to Peace demo, this time we got to do it with a buch of Shaolin monks.  Some of their stuff was cheesy, but every once in a while they would bust out some crazy wushu.  Aside from the lack of air conditioning I'd say the demo was pretty successful.

Afterwards I had dinner at a Salvadorian restaurant with Lucas, Jason and Paula.  Which was good since da homeboy Lucas is going to be in chengdu for the next year.  Holla.

Baby girl is being pretty obstinate about going to sleep. I think it is gas pain, so it's not like she is just being mean.  But the last couple of days seem like it has been really hard to get her to go down. My best put-Leah-to-sleep technique is the computer desk knee bounce:  I get a big pillow, and lie her sideways across it.  Sit in at the computer desk and scoot up close.  Put the baby/pillow bundle in my lap so the pillow is trapped between my torso and the side of the desk.  And I do that little nervous knee bounce. AKA Shake your money away.  Sometimes it works like a charm and she is out quick, other times I am simply bouncing a crying baby.  Either way, I have a computer to help entertain me, so I tend to say happier longer. The success rate is at least double my normal techniques.]]></content:encoded>

<title>Spent the past weekend in Richmond.</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[We just went down so that my family could see Leah.  Laura hadn't been able to come up with Amiee so it was nice that she could meet her.  We plan on being down in Richmond every other week for a while.  There was this past weekend, in two weeks is my ten year class reunion, and two weeks after that is when Laura is scheduled to deliver Joel.  That next trip is key if I am going to get her to change the baby's name to Job.

<img src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/leah/image/595/IMG_6033.JPG" class="picture" align="left" />I spent some quality time on Saturday outside by the trampoline.  Jacob was showing me his front flips and working on back drops.  Joshua didn't like it when we bounced him to high, but I made sure he had plenty of time to play too.  Honestly I think he had more fun digging in the leaves and attacking Jacob with giant sticks while he tried to jump.  Later I took Jacob out and we worked on some wushu moves.  I taught him stomp down, front snap kick and wheeling arms (aka the hard one).  He did surprisingly well, but I still think he should take gymnastics--he was landing front flips on his feet.  Of course once his feet hit the mat they were quickly followed by a butt, then shoulders, then head.  But his control was impressive, especially when I told him to go up before he flips and he did. That's hard to do, especially when you are first learning.

Since Saturday was our 6th anniversary, so we gave Leah to my parents and we went out for a fancy dinner.  Headed down to the Shacho strip an d went to the Tobacco company for some pricy yet tasty fare.  My 'rents took Leah to Extra Billy's, I admit I wasn't really thrilled with the idea that they were taking her out, sure we had done it, but the new parent thing was kicking in, and I had assumed that they would stay in with the baby.  Of course my parents were fine, and Leah slept the entire time -- plus we got some Texas smoked sausage out of it.

Sunday we had dinner at Grandma's.  And before dinner was pool time.  Kelly and  Leah sat in the shade and enjoyed the nice breeze.  I enjoyed the ridiculously warm water with the nephews.  Jacob and I had a great time battling the inflatable whale.  He found some time to work in some wushu moves practice.

I leave you with a picture of a baby on a cat:

<title>Still got a baby.</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/leah/image/595/IMG_6267.JPG" class="picture" />
  
  Kelly and I have been enjoying our adventures in sleep deprived parenthood.  Kelly decided Monday night that I was running on a few too little hours that she put me to bed at 10 and didn't wake me up till 6.  I don't know if my math is accurate, but that is nearly 8 hours.  Needless to say I felt pretty great all of yesterday.  I felt a bit guilty about having her shift run all night long, but she seemed to be doing pretty well.  Last night we were back to our normal rotation: Kelly sleeps form 10 to 2, I get 2 till morning.  Where morning is either when I have to leave for work or help with the baby, whichever comes first.  Again, luckily the company is nice enough to give me really flexible hours so when I stroll in at 11 they don't bat an eye.  Not something I want to sustain, but it sure is useful with munchkin-pant's sleeping schedule.

Speaking of pants.  Kelly and I have adopted a pants-based baby jargon.  While it might sound bizarre to most people I think it is fun to say and have enjoyed replacing some of the normal baby words with 'pants.'  For example, 'pooping' is now 'making pants.' Gas pains are 'workin' on pants.' When Leah gets cranky and tired she is 'sleepy pants.' Admittedly, a lot of the pants words are related to poop, but if you consider how much of Leah's time and effort is dedicated to the subject is seems reasonable.

Bit of unsolicited advice: When your baby needs to be pacified and you have no pacifier, and are in the mood for something extremely weird, I recommend sticking you nose in her mouth.  She just goes to town sucking it.  Sure, if your nose is available your fingers are probably too, but they don't address that extreme weird mood we talked about.  It's almost as much fun as a baby on a cat.

Everyone at wushu is going off to junior worlds, so I am gonna be running a few classes there.  I don't think Kelly is exactly thrilled at the idea of me spending 4 hours MIA a few times next week.  Luckily I will have the flexibility to defer to some of the other coaches if she needs me at home.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Tony Jaa was in DC yesterday -- a mere two blocks from my office.  He did a little demo at Woodrow Wilson Plaza.  So I took off after a work sponsored lunch to check it out.  Oddly enough I knew like 20 people there, lets hear it for wushu connections.  It was cool running into Emily and the CMAI gang plus Dennis and Co.

Mad props to Dennis for the picture.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last week, Tuesday I think, I walked to wushu.  On my walk to wushu I took this short cut.  This is a great shortcut; it takes off a good 5 or 10 minutes from the trip from the metro station to O-Mei.  It is not a great shortcut because you must cut through a bunch of brush.  And by brush I mean poison ivy.  It didn't really kick in until Friday when I started to itch consistently.  Saturday and Sunday we spent in Richmond, where I was miserable the entire time.  I started making routine trips to the drug store, this way I broke it up so as I slowly bought one of every over the counter anti-itch and poison ivy medication I didn't notice how much money I was spending.  At one point I bought a 1 oz tube of poison ivy scrub for a whopping $40.  At least it worked better than any of the cheaper stuff.

By Monday I was nearly insane.  So I went to the doctor and they gave me mood altering drugs.  Since rashes were popping up randomly the doc said it was obviously a systemic reaction.  Thusly I am on the juice.

I did spend some time googling for treatments, and the constant itch has driven people to do some very weird things.  And since the only home treatment I could think of up to this point was a soldering iron to burn the itch away (that searing pain would be such a sweet release), I decided that the hair drier idea was a more sensible choice.  Point the blower at a breakout and just hold it there for as long as you can.  Before it becomes he most intense pain experienced by a human it is the most intense itch.  But if you old out for 10 or 20 seconds it blossoms into that glorious pain.  By the time you stop the itching is gone.  And gone for a few hours.  I don't know if it is the prednisone kicking in or if the hair drier is responsible--heck maybe it is the steroid cream--but things are manageable now.

We didn't leave for Richmond until after Anne's (as in Andy and Anne) shower.  Kelly ran off to the shower to play with the girls, while I stood out front of Beej's house holding Leah, noticing that Beej was defiantly not home.  So once Kelly returned to get me we dropped her off and I met up with Beej at Taco bell.  This is a surreal experience.  We had my college roommates and their kids all running 'round while the four guys tried wrangle them.  Johnny apparently forgot that we had baby girl, so as lugged in the car seat he had a 'oh, that's right' moment.  I never would have imagined that moment before now--Johnny, Beej, Andy and I all being dads.  Dragging the munchkins out to taco bell.  How very college-y of us.

 Simply for the sake of excess we headed down to Richmond for Laura's shower.  Amiee set up a nice Sunday afternoon pool party/baby shower.  I played with Jacob in the pool and chatted with the fam.  We wound up sneaking out a bit early since Leah was getting a little fussy, Kelly was isolate in the house and we wanted to beat traffic.  Traffic still sucked. The traffic is THE reason we don't go to Richmond more.  So frustrating.  A million times more frustrating when the itching won't stop. That drive is where I had the brilliant idea of killing it with a soldering iron.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Since I hadn't been to wushu in a while I thought I should drop in and see how things were going, and if I was gonna do that I should bring Leah in, cause she is the one that people there really want to see. So, yesterday I asked Kelly if she would bundle up the baby and get me from the metro.  Best part, or maybe the real reason I wanted Kelly come up to Merrifield, was we could go grab a nice dinner.  Kelly made me an amazing dinner the day before (blackend pork chops with pineapples) and I think I wanted to return the favor.  The only thing that would come close would be a fun dinner at Sweet Water.  So after stopping by a pungent wushu school we headed there.  Leah slept politely most of the time, but once she saw us eating I think she got jealous and wanted to eat some herself, so we fed her.  Feeding a baby only leads to changing a baby.  I did the classy dad thing, I was handed her to her mother and said I think she needs to be changed.  So Kelly grabbed a diaper, some wipes and skipped off to bathroom.  It seemed like twenty minutes went by and I see my wife walking briskly back to the table carrying a naked baby.  Well, she had a diaper on.  And a bib, but I am pretty sure mama just put that on there to make is seem like she was wearing clothes. Didn't fool me. Apparently, as  soon as Leah's pants were removed she just went to town and soaked her onesie.  Kelly whom had chosen to travel light didn't have the diaper bag and its extra change of clothes with her.  She didn't even have her phone to give me a call to delver clothes, but it's not like I could really go into the women's bathroom.

Oh, and Neal and I decided last night that Leah is too pretty to punch.  Ya'know since we all the time be talkin' bout punchin babies.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I brought the wife and kid to richmond for my 10 year highschool reunion.  We havn't had the reunion yet, that happens in 3 hours, but that's why we are here in richmond. For added fun Nikki came back from Italy.  She came back for visa helarity, but I like to think she just wanted to see Leah.

Right now Leah and Kelly are happy and watching football.  Leah is talkin' bout it and smiling. So, no more blogging for me--I gots some football and women's to attend to.  Jiayou Hokies!

Please comment if you get this.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Lost in Kansas.

Now that the weather changed my allergies are really acting up.  Very annoying--I feel tired a lot, sore throat and the sinuses just hurt.  To make things more fun I am coaching wushu from  5 to 9 tonight.

I coached earlier this week, and I really had to lay down the law.  I think the kids have gotten away with so much for so long  but I won't have it.  I had a couple of kids on the verge of tears because they wanted to play a game instead of training wushu.  They came to wushu class and had to do wushu.  So sad.

I have decided I want to champion two points.  Lining up (you'd think they could do this), and the terminology to the splits.  This splits things is a serious pet pev of mine.  The martial arts community cannot decide on standardized names for the kinds of splits.  Originally I used 'front' and 'side' to defrerciate the kinds of splits.  But some schools consider front splits to be where you are facing front and your legs go off to the sides, while others think front splits are when your leg is stretched out to the front (and the other back).  So I have decided to go with the gymnastics nomenclature: Straddles and Splits.  Straddles are you legs out to the side while you face forward.  Splits are left or right splits.  Now the part the kids don't understand is a sitting straddle (sitting with you legs apart is not the same as a straddle.  They also giggle whenever I say pubu, and I get a lot of "poopoo" mumbles. And they are Chinese.  Aiya.

Leah Marie is doing well.  She had a bit of the sniffles, but is seems to be getting better.  It is quite frustrating that can doesn't know to blow her nose.  So I am forced to use the little bulb boogie sucker thing--which normally don't little more than make her mad.  However, last night I had a very productive boogie sucking.  I think the trick is to put her on her ball and let her work some of it down to where I can get it. The flip her over and boogie suck!  She was breathing clearly for an hour.  I don't think she really cared, but I felt accomplished.

She really smiles and talks these days.  It is interesting the things she really likes: Efalump the elephant, The Baby Butt song, Tummy time on the beach ball, and ceiling monsters.  These things have been known to snap her out of grumpy right into happy.

The Baby Butt Song
The baby, has a naked but, a naked butt, a naked butt
The baby has a naked but and Mommy cleaned her up
The baby, is one the ground, on the ground, on the ground
The baby is on the ground, wiggling 'round
The baby is talkin' to me, talkin' to me, talkin' to me
The baby is talking to me, 'cause I'm the one she sees.

I'm still working on it, but I have a few more verses I am working out, I hope to get 5 or 6 good ones, plus it lends it self to adlib about the current situation.

Ever notice that 'yeah' and 'Leah' are only one letter off?  It's cause they are fun to shout when you're happy.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Leah likes to play a few games.
<ul><li>Ball</li><li>Run and Kick (and skip and kick)</li><li>Sweatshirt</li><li>1-2-3-4</li><li>Ski Jump</li><li>Rolling over</li><li>Over the leg</li><li>Looking at lights</li><li>Ceiling Monster</li><li>Hiccups</li><li>Ampere's neck trick
</li></ul>We are pretty sure Sweatshirt is her favorite game.  Rolling over is probably the scariest one we have.

Coach gets back into town this week, and I think Kelly might have to call her and say no more compulsory volenteer work from her husband for a while.  I think the kids will be happy--last time I taught I had one of the boys come up to me with a condecending "you're not gonna teach this class are you?  You do everything all wrong."  I am pretty sure that comment it directly related to no game at the beginning of class and my insistance that we drill basics until your legs don't work.   Oh, we are making progress on the lining up!  I am sure all my hard work will go flying out the window 10 minuites after coach returns, but it was a good exercise in teaching  smug lil wushuers.

Hmmm, I got my Mahler seminar in like 2 months--I need to be doing alot more swings if I am going to be in good enough shape to learn how to be in good shape.

In closing:  If you are going to call me a white boy and say inapproprate things about my mother before you demand money, at least have a breath mint.]]></content:encoded>

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hey Chris, what's up.....?!? I'm back at the blogger community (not at O-Mei yet though) Hey don't worry, I like the way you teach, you consider every detail (I still remember how you taught me the compulsory barehand that I wiggled my right arm too much during the block and the kick and how I should swing the staff during the bodyturn on the compulsory staff). School is crazy!!! Read my confession as a Ph.D. student..... That's why I haven't been able to come to O-Mei lately, I might be coming 2 weeks from now though (Saturday).



Anyway, your baby is developing great progress.....=) I never had the chance to see her though..... Well, see you on Saturday 2 weeks from now (October 21, 2006)]]></wp:comment_content>

<title>Baby Butterfly Twists</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I actually wrote the following post last week, but never had a chance to finish it.  I am been so preoccupied with life I haven't even been keeping up with reading people's blogs, much less writing my own. I had Kelly read Gerald's and give me the play by play on Nikki and Neal -- but I really have no idea what is going on in anyone else's life right 'bout now.

Work is actually a lot of fun, we have some neat projects, possibly even some we might be able to patent (so if anyone knows how to go about that, lemme know).  Fun work is fun.

Leah has mastered rolling.  She can now do complete 360s.  I like to think of them as baby butterfly twists.

<i>Sleeping in her bumbo</i>

Last night we had a bit of baby drama.  We were up til 5 am because Kelly had to go and sneeze.  I had a hard time getting her to go down, at first I thought it was because I was trying to do with out the swaddling blanket, but hindsight says they may have been more to it.  So I finally got her a sleep thanks to the blanket and swing, and got her upstairs and settled into her bassinet, I laid down exhausted and about 15 minutes later Kelly sneezed.  Apparently Leah thought this was the scariest thing she had ever heard ever, and wanted to tell us about it, because she screamed with every thing she had. It took us two hours to get her back down.  While the sneeze may have awakened the baby, I think it was gas pains that kept her up (and possibility explained the afore mentioned trouble getting to sleep).

<i>Bla! Cat hair!</i>

<hr />

It's been a while, I have been a little more than busy.  Unfortunately for you, it's not exactly the most exciting kind of busy.  At work my website went into production so I have been fielding all sorts of fun quirks with that.  Dealing with those bug fixes really gets in the way of the new development that I want to do.

Leah Marie is still the greatest baby ever.  I think she is getting settled into her routine, of course Kelly is the on who gets up if she wakes at 3 in the morning, but she seems to be doing better and better at night.  A few potholes on the road to sleepytown, but consistent progress. She is talking more and more, and really likes to stand up and look around.  Which contrasts when we first brought her home and standing made her very sad.

So far we are thrilled with our day care lady, she cooks for Kelly when she comes for lunch visits, and is absolutely awesome with Leah.  I don't think we could be happier. The only bad think about the situation is Kelly's work is currently her team is red lined and going insane because of it.]]></content:encoded>

<title>Pumpkin Patch</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[We took little miss Leah out to visit her very first pumpkin patch.  Burke nursery has a big fall carnival with all sorts of crazy pony rides, spooky castles, and trains built out of hay.  We didn't really want to drop $13/person to take out 4 month old among the stuff she could care less about, and we didn't.  We were able to go to the pumkin patch area for free and had our little photo op.  Leah was a bit dumbfounded by all the things to look at and wasn't too smilie, but she humored us and sat there for most of the pictures.

<img src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/leah/image/595/IMG_7792.JPG" class="picture" />
(Shortly after this was taken, she did her stiff as a board trick and moved the pumpkin just enough so that she could topple over.  She cried.  Some lady gave me a dirty look.)

The weekend was pretty relaxed.  I skipped wushu on Saturday to play with the ladies (and they wanted to play watching football).  Terps beat FSU and we were thrilled. The Tulli brought over some tasty BBQ on Sunday because grandpa just had to see Leah. I can't blame him.  Plus I like BBQ.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<i>Have a poor recap of my Vegas trip.  Don't let the poor recap fool you, the trip was great it's just my writing that stinks.</i>

Last weekend I went to Vegas, for Todd's 30th birthday.  Now, since he is the same age as me, he didn't turn 30 this year.  But we went anyway.  Marilee tells me that's cause  he couldn't make it for his actual 30th.  Close enough.

I got to travel with Beej, and we roomed with Johnny.  We did like we were supposed to and all met up so we could surprised Todd at a bar in the Paris, but his brother rolled in and ruined the surprise.  He also got Tod toasty, while not quite as fun made for a decent consolation prize.

We hung out for a while until Todd was dragging and the three of us returned to the frontier and a few games.  We had no idea this was going to be the best run of the trip, and should have stopped then, but we had fun and were up nicely.  Not bad for the high rollers like us that slap down a twenty and ask for it all in dollar chips.  Surprised we didn't get comped a room.

We were still on east coast time so we woke up the Eshler's and headed their way for breakfast. Hung out for the afternoon had a fancy dinner and Beej and I headed off to  see Ka.  Qiu Dong hooked us up and we were able to watch from the light booth, which was crazy fun.  We got treated all special and were able to go back stage and meet up with Xing Xing.  He gave us the grand tour and we got to poke around behind the stage.  I was pretty pumped when Jen came up and said "hi." I didn't want to harass her on the job (im sure they get more than enough of that), but it was great fun watching Beej's reaction when cirque people knew me.  I think the best part of the tour was realizing I woudn't trade my job/house/baby for that gig I wanted so badly a few years ago.  Sure I would have much better abs, but I am glad that them French Canadians shot me down.

After the show Beej went to meet up with the gang and I grabbed a second dinner with DX.  Apparently china town in Vegas is 3 strip malls with a dozen Zu Zai Nai Cha shops. I stuffed my self and we chatted about cirque and a baby then he dropped me back at the strip.  I found out Todd ate something bad and wasn't feelign too well and somehow it was 1am (3am east coast).  So they had headed back to the room and crashed.

Sleeping is nice. I like sleep.

Next morning we headed back to Paris for the breakfast buffet.  We timed it perfectly.  It's $13 for breakfast, $18 for lunch; and changes over at 11 am.  We got in about quarter till, so we got both for the cheaper price.  I think I had a half dozen plates of food.  I still crave the crepes they made us. And the breakfast hummus. And the prime rib. And the flan.

Our flight home wasn't till 11, so we had the rest of the day to chill.  We hung out in Todd's room, felt bad and left him to sleep.  For some reason Johnny wanted to see the Luxor. So we walked all the way almost there.  Stopped and shook our fists at him and headed back to find Beej.  With nothing better to do we wondered around looking for some cheap tables to play.  I played for 2 or 3 hours and broke dead even.  Johnny and Marilee tried their luck. We watched a leprechaun poor apple liqueur directly into peoples mouths.

We had a tasty tex-mex dinner and jumped on our all-night flight.  Tex-mex isn't the best choice of preflight eating, but I won't go into that here.

Red eye flights are not nice.  I do not like them.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Long weekend, full of kettle bells and cirque.  Both were good and I am glad I spent the money to go to them -- but I hardly feel refreshed this monday.

That was until I looked at pictures of the baby.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Ok, last week we were about to go insane, things are much better now.

We think Leah hit a growth spurt over two weeks ago and with the teething symptoms everything was thrown out of wack.  We actually had her sleeping through the night and that slipped away from us.  Mostly her dad's fault because during her growth spurt I was feeding her in the middle of the night (hey, she was really hungry) and then she began to expect that.  Well, things sort of snowballed and she got all out of wack, which threw Kelly off.  Add in a little workin' mama hell and you (well, me, the unsuspecting yet well intentioned dad) had a situation on his hands.

So enter thanks giving week,  Thankfully we had a few extra days off work and some extra resources (grandparents everywhere) and things are under much better control.

We are going to be much stricter about her eat and nap schedule, and I think that is a big step.  Now that we have been doing that for 3 (count 'em 3) days she seems to take to it nicely.  Then the big problem, the reason we even care about a schedule, the sleep. It's not bed time, or putting the baby down--it is sleep training.

I love training. Unfortunately, as past experience shows me, it normally lacks fun at the time of training. This is the most funless training ever.

We did a bunch of research, bought some condescending yet informative books and read everything the internet had to say about sleeping babies.  The internet says alot of conflicting things about sleeping babies.

Deciding to do the Ferber method (which is what our baby wise book appears to endorse) we let her CIO for a few naps, and attempt a down-for-the-night with limited success.

Yesterday I started second guessing out tactics, as Ferber says to wait till 6 months. Which was prolly just my excuse because listening to my daughter cry is hands down the worst thing ever conceived of ever. And I don't like it.

Tonight we tried to sooth her a little more when we put her down.  The problem was she would wake up once she hit the crib and be happy and awake.  I didn't expect that.  She was supposed to be tired and sleepy but crying.  Nah, she was just as happy as could be.  We knew she was tired before we brought her up (glazed over and constantly rubbing her eyes), but looked pretty alert in her crib. Since she wasn't crying, and we wouldn't be rewarding her for crying--we picked her up and continued to walk her.  That, of all things, made her fuss.  But we made progress and were able to get her to go to sleep with active soothing (however, in her crib).  That lasted 45 minutes. Kelly put her foot down and we agreed that we would try to just leave her for 10 minutes.

So far so good, she has been out for another 45 min now and I am about to turn in. I am still a little nervous that the monitor will go off any second, but will be optimistic for a full night.

If you got this far you may have a problem.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm back in weird Austin.  Worked a long, long day--but in the end it appeared to be successful.  We'll see how things pay off for the company.  Good experience and visibility either way.

Our trip has been a exercise in starving our selves of food and sleep then gorging on massive meals and hitting the caffeine.  There has been way too much tex mex.  Even the Italian was tex mex--I ordered some pasta filled with spinach and they brought me Italian enchiladas.   Seriously, if you were more than 5 feet away you couldn't tell.

Austin does win over DC in the bum polite contest.  They come up and feign usefulness and when they finally get to asking for hand outs they are nice and say thanks anyway if you turn them down.  Not quite what I get out side of metro center.  However, I feel less safe here.  Maybe they are a little too nice.

There are many stories to be told, but we are getting on a plan tomorrow for the S-dizzle, and I still have work that I need to do tonight so I am out.

In closing, wushu is a man's man sport. And thanks to the 2006 China Nats I have proof:

We did it, we stood in lines and paid WAY too much, but we got pictures of the baby with Santa.  The picture was snapped half a second too early, because this was the start of the smile--she had a big ol grin right after this.  Well, I don't mind if I am the one who gets the good pictures of my daughter.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I spent most of last week in Austin with work, then we headed out to San Diego for an entire day before getting home just in time for my birthday.  My ladies and I had a nice birthday weekend, very low key.  We spent a lot of the weekend hanging out in the basement near a nice fire.  Smores and foof chairs for everyone.  Kelly got Leah and I matching Virginia Tech hoodies--the best birthday presents ever.

<img src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/leah/image/595/IMG_8482.jpg" class="picture" />

Things at work have seemed to calm down.  That's mostly because our "partner" has decided to not actually do anything at all, so we can just do it.  Sad thing is it reduces the amount of work we have to do.  Thus the reason for the quote marks around partner.

Christmas is fast approaching and we are completely unprepared.  Normally Kelly handles all the Christmas shopping for us, but her little helper is impairing the ability to waste hours running around malls.  We wanted to try and do all our gift shopping online, but I am worried we missed the deadline for shipping in time for Christmas.  So if you get a gift card from us please don't think we are anti-thoughtful, we are just first time parents who like our baby too much to drag her to an over crowded tysons corner after her bed time.

I actually went to wushu last night, first time in a few weeks.  Stephon is back and it seemed like he never left.  Heck it was better than before he left.  I think is break was good for the guy.  And I am very happy to have adults back in class.  Not that I am ever in class, but on the rare occasion that I make it, it is nice.  I did come to the conclusion that on the days I train I don't get to see my daughter.  I don't like that one bit.  And my knee was bugging me a little, but I think with this can't-see-Leah thing that is not going to be the thing holding me back.

Leah has developed a new trick.  She dances.  If she is lying on her back she will grin real big and sorta bend her torso back and forth to the sides.  It is the greatest thing ever.  I am fairly convinced she is mimicking her mom and I.  We will often lie her in the pack and play and sing and dance to her, which she finds very entertaining.  This trick is almost as much fun as her big greeting smile when you walk in the room and she recognizes you.

Stuff like that makes me want to go snatch her out of the crib in the middle of the night to play.  Her mom won't let her come down to play though.  Party pooper.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[But first, an easy way to feel stupid:    After making an appointment and writing down the directions I hopped in the truck and drove it to the appointment I had made to get the check engine light looked at.  Unfortunately the engine light was on in Kelly's car, not my truck.  That got me into work a little later than I had planned. 

    Leah wasn't feeling too good this past weekend.  She has officially been sick now.  We almost made it 6 months with out her getting ill, yesterday she had a fever and a lot of congestion.  She had actually been congested for a few days before that, nothing too bad just a snuffly nose.  Yesterday was different, she didn't eat too much and she grumbled all day.  Never a full cry, but a constant complaining whimper.  Easily the saddest sounds ever.  The congestion provoked a nasty cough. We tried to suction the boogies out of her nose, with some success, but that makes her super mad.  She sure loves her boogies and doesn’t like it when we take them.

    We called to doctor once her fever broker 100, but they seem to think it is an ear infection.  I am not so sure, the internet tells me that teething can cause these symptoms so I am inclined to think that is the cause. Kelly should be at the doctor now and we will find out for sure.  Luckily we had a regularly scheduled appointment today. 

    The rest of the weekend was fun, had a couple of holiday gatherings.  Games night was the biggest ever.  Darpa peoples we run but Kelly missed out because of the baby (and honestly she was the one everyone wanted to see).  We even had a fun lunch with the Suns at a crazy Japanese buffet in Fair Oaks.  Leah spit up all over Mrs. Sun and the table.   But at a sushi place you practically expect people to vomit.  Right?

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Leah may have shed her squeakers nickname but she has officially picked up a new one, Chompers. All the drooling and fussing and grumble cakes has produced her first tooth.  It is not all the way though, so we are still a bit grumpy, but I am certain she will have it in properly by Christmas.  Front teeth for Christmas!  Good timing baby!

She is about over he cold, about finished with this tooth almost back to her happy self.  I was getting worried we were not going to see the happy Leah again.  Normally in the morning she is all smiles, or if you lie her down in her pack and play she would dance and coo, but recently if we set her down she should immediately get mad and scream some unhappy things.  She is not back to her super happy self but we are making huge progress.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I am pretty psyched about going to CES--and on official business non-the-less. It'll be fun to see our stuff in action.

Things at work have been insane while we try to get ready.  We have a few more things to polish up but we are headed off to meet up with the people to do just that, so we should be in good shape.  *knock*knock*

Worst part is leaving the ladies for two weeks, but my trifecta of travel should keep me more than occupied. Austin, Ft. Worth and Vegas!

Maybe, just maybe I will have some time to catch up on my log while I travel. Maybe.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I am finally back home, and it is good to be back.  I missed my ladies while I was gone, but I was also extremely busy the entire time so I didn't have much time to do that missing.

The trip started off in Austin, which was still weird, but I am liking it better there every time we go back.  Not only is there good music in many of the restaurants downtown but you hear quality stuff just walking around out side.  Jamie's Spanish Village is our regular spot, but I am convinced there are better places around.  Plus it may be in the worst place downtown.  Not your best neighborhood.

Most of the time in Austin was spent in meetings where the big important people discussed big important things that--mostly--didn't concern me.  I actually had to leave their company offices to run to a coffee shop to get an internet connection so I could do some very urgent work for that company that refused to give me an internet connection.

After Austin, I opted to not return to DC with my coworkers, but to go to Fort Worth ad visit family.  I basically invaded Claudia's house and she spent the better part of the weekend entertaining me when I wasn't caught up in extremely urgent graphics work for the aforementioned company.  It was good to see my cousins again, the crazy pair they are. My Grandpa Jim was looking thin and it was very odd to see him using a walker, but he seemed to be in good spirits.  I think he will enjoy Leah's visit next month.

Claudia dropped me off at a shuttle on Monday so I could make the trip to Vegas. Once I got there I met up with the boys from work and the CES whirlwind started. Navigating the Hotels to find check-in and the different keynotes was a major hassle--apparently they don't allow the conferences to post signs anywhere.  There are very few maps and the signage is ambiguous. Its like once they get you inside they don't want you to leave.  We eventually got our badges and even found the big keynote the next morning.  Got some great seats and I watched as my boss played the business game with investors, partners and clients.  I wasn't into that as much as making my way around to look at all the cool new toys.  I got to play with the OLPC computer, new moto phones and all sorts of crazy video games.  It was great walking up to random booths and geeking out over the stuff the had.  I could tell if it was an engineer or a business/sales/management person in the booth in 10 seconds flat.  I tried to talk exclusively to the nerds, they were much more fun.

I witnessed many of those biz-sa-man types acting like they were way more important than they were.  Typically they would be  very condescending and expect the unreasonable out of a given company's products.  They would scoff and thrash about if the rep didn't promise to meet their demands.

The hotel we stayed in was crazy cool, albeit far from the strip.  I recommend the Red Rock, but only if you are going to rent a car.  Parking on the strip is much easier than you'd think.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Slicer and Dicer are coming.

Baby girl actually slept through the night last night, and I credit the Tylenol.  We had a number of mid-night wakings recently, coupled with a grumpy girl that didn't want to take her bottle when we she was going down for bed.  So we were uncertain if she was hungry and fed her in the wee hours.  But last night was a success.  And we had a happy smiley baby this morning all alert and ready to play with toys.

I can't blame her toys are fun.

I just wanted to tell you about the new teeth, and if anyone as any suggestions for names of teeth, please let me know.  Because I have already started down that path and it might be too late to not name them all.

Back to CSS hell.  Holla.]]></content:encoded>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[It was a pretty long and involved weekend.  This was due to two unrelated things.  1) Leah decided it would be entertaining to crawl properly and 2) The washing machine thought it would be fun to flood the basement.

First, the entertaining one.  Leah can propel her self forward to places that she decides are interesting.  This is coupled with her other main intrest, getting up higher.  She will cawl over to a near by item, a peice of furniture or a bumbo, and attempt to either climb on top of it or use it to stand more upright.  She has not perfected either the crawling or the climbing, so this means inattentive parents can result in  bonked heads.  Waling and nashing of tooth ensues.

As a result she is becomign more and more fun to play with. Giggling and happy shrieking all up and down the floor.

Second, the washing machine mishap.  Or as I like to think of it, the soggy sudsy stinky carpet with all our clothes on it.  While Kelly normally handles the clothes cleaning, I thought I would help Kelly out and run a few loads of laundry.  Due to baby sized distractions we had accumulated quite the pile of laundry in the basement--I believe the cats had taken to calling it Mt. Truxion--so I gathered up a handful and ran a load.  All good.  Got the second one going and went about my business.  Well during that second load the machine decided it would just keep the water flowing.  Did all its normal stuff, but the water kept on coming.  When we finally discovered this I freaked out (squishy brown carpet does that to me) and started twisting and pulling all the knobs on the thing.  I even unplugged it. The water just kept coming.  It was like a evil possessed demon machine.  Nothing would stop it.  Nothing could.  Kelly walked around and shut off the water.  The water stopped. But there we were water flowing under all the shelves, under my media rack, and most annoyingly into the carpet.  We hauled what we could to safety.  Wet-vac'd and mopped.   Worked up a good foam on the carpet which brought flashbacks to the Tide insolent of a few years ago. I find it best not to dwell on the horrors of the past.

Eventually we got things under control, propped the carpet up on and ironing board and stacks of paint cans with a box fan running and sorted the clothes into hampers.  We had to get up early so we could go to the 'dorf in time to do our laundry before Neal's graduation dinner thing.

In closing: Giant multi-national computer corporations will say things like "if we give you the UI spec today can you have it ready in a week?"  Gah!]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Our washing machine is fixed. Kelly proclaimed that I was the hero. I like that.

Now, the lulaby that I made up for Leah:

Hush little baby, don't say a word
Daddy's gonna buy you the Hokie Bird
And if the hokie bird don't gobble
daddy's gonna buy you a weeble wobble
And if that weeble wobble falls down
Daddy's gonna buy you a pretty gown
And if that pretty gown don't fit
Daddy's gonna buy you a baseball mitt
And if that mitt don't catch
Daddy's gonna buy you a wodden match
And if that match won't light
Daddy's gonna buy you a bright red kite
And if that Kite won't fly
Daddy's gonna sing you a lulaby
And if that lulaby don't rhyme
Then it must be baby girl's bed time]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last weekend Leah had the most fun being a dinosaur.  She would get up on her knees stick her arms out in front and growl, roar and otherwise make dino-sounds.  For added effect she would grab the animals from her Noah's Ark set and wave them around with an occasional slobbery biting.  It was the cutest thing ever. She practiced it for a few days and perfected her impression.  But as soon as she did she moved on to the 'D' sounds.  As much as I like words she can say that start with D, I miss the dino-baby.

I shouldn’t complain because she is saying dada with regularity.  In fact Kelly brought her in to say goodbye to me this morning and she looked right at me and said dada.  I know she doesn’t associate that word with me yet--but she will, and that is good enough for me.  She does ramble on and on telling us stories with many of the words starting with her favorite new sound.  Some sample words include: Da Do Dyoi Duh and Doh.

She tells the best stories.

Kelly keeps asking me when I am going to go back to wushu, adding 'it's been two months' for effect.  While I am sure there is no way I would have let 2 months go by with no training, I think she does have a point.  I need to get back for the exercise if anything.  I have been feeling inflexible recently--which I am going to blame on work more than not wushu.  Something about marathon coding that'll make your hip flexors tight.  Stupid western chairs.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[The more people that try to do C level movements the more people don't make their nandu.

So I was a judge at collegiates this past weekend, which was a very good exercise in practicing my judging skills.  Since I was a C judge I got very familiar with the software that they use for tallying up the nandu scores.  Now that I am familiar with it I would like to rewrite it from scratch. Shouldn't be hard to roll a new version out and would be a fun little python/sqlite project. I think some of the issues they were trying to design around are irrelevant now that we have used it in practice.

The tournament was run amazingly well, I think the best run wushu tournaments I have been too to date.  They had a good crowd there, the venue was bigger than we needed so we were able to spread out.  Kevin and Justin ran their respective carpets smoothly and Mario added his own special metro sexual flavor to the event. Them wushu turtles did a good job.

After the main event, we hung around for the tricks contest.  I was a little sad I didn't succumb to Lil Alex's plea to participate.  Especially when they had the back tuck melee and the butterfly contest.  The winner had 18.5 butterfly's.  Bah!

We met up with the Tulli for some year-of-the-pig bbq.  Tasty.  Leah had a pretty good time till she started getting a little cranky and required someone to stand and hold her.

After dinner Neal and I hopped in the car and drove to the metro where so we could ride out to Georgetown.  Wushu after party in a the lounge of a greek restaurant us surprisingly fun.  It was awesome to hang with everyone, so many people I hadn't seen  in years.  Kevin, James, Dean, Y -- the whole gang was there.  I got toasty, bought a few people drinks.  Had a great time.

The ride home was a bit of a debacle.  We missed our transfer stop twice.  If that don't make you feel dumb then missing the turn to get home will. We made it and a mere hour later than we would have if we knew what we were doing.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I spent all day thinking it was Thursday.  It is not.  It is Wednesday.

This is actually a good thing, because I have been in a panic all day trying to get stuff done for the big project. But because of this I am in a little situation.  I made a big deal about how I wasn't going to be in the office tomorrow, ordering people around and pushing for extra help all day today.  Now tomorrow I will get "aren't you supposed to be on a plane" from everyone.  I feel so smrt.

I feel as if I have a few options

A) Stay home
B) Act like they are the crazy ones
C) Do lots of back tucks and aerials so they talk about that instead

Lets go with A.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/blog/image/595/IMG_0255.jpg" class="picture" />
I came home tonight and found this on the fridge.

<img src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/blog/image/595/IMG_0221.jpg" class="picture" />
Swingin' on some swings!

<img src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/blog/image/595/IMG_0253.jpg" class="picture" />
We Built a fort at work.  It was not appreciated.  Drat monkeys.

I know I have been leaving poor 'lil bloggie out of the loop recently, so here is a little recap.

As you can see from the pictures Leah is promptly becoming the cutest baby ever.  She properly fun now.  I know Kelly liked her teeny tiny little baby, but seriously, all she did was lie around and poo.  Now she can crawl--and when she wants to crawl fast.  It is the best thing, when she gets going really fast she does this high stepping thing where she picks up her knees and hands as high as she can then slams them back down on the floor to propel her along. I would think it would hurt her knees, but she doesn't seem to mind.

Yesterday she was wearing a pretty, pretty dress and had a hard time crawling in  it. Being the resourceful kid she is, she developed a crazy crawling-on-her-feet technique.  COHF (pronounced cough) propulsion.  She scooted across the floor with them little bloomers sticking up in the air, attacking the cats and removing magnets form the fridge with glee.

Last night I was supposed to go to wushu since Wednesday is the early class, but I skipped because it was so nice out side and I wanted to play with my ladies.  And we played out in the front yard, chatted with the neighbors and ate leaves.  Well, one of us ate leaves.  Them leafs might be more fun than toys. I still think pinecones and sticks are all the toys kids need.  Not that I don't want to buy more toys (the little people sets are crazy fun, I want the Pirate Ship. And the Zoo. And the Barn) but I think kids have just as much fun with the basics.  And we need to be saving, because there is one day that she will want iFrogs and sellPhones and other crazy gadgets (the answer of course is no, sorry Leah).

At work I have been buried in my big project.  It is a lot of fun to design and build a big component from the ground up, but the fact that it is about 3 times more complicated than it needs to be is a little unsettling.  You may ask, Chris, if you designed and built it, why0oh-why is it so much more complicated than it needs to be.  Well, it's in the requirements.  Specifically it needed to be buzzword compliant. The software world is obsessed with these words and all their buzzing. It has really gotten our of hand.

Of course we have been fairly agreeable on this specific project, because if it works out like we hope it will, then we can do some cool stuff down the line.  Way down the line, but this gets a big item crossed off our list.

Unfortunately, all this work at work (and at home) leave no time for personal geeky projects.  The last thing I did was shorten my mouse cord.  While useful I also have a couple of bigger projects I really should pay attention to--specifically the  wushu tournament software I'd like to dig into. Hopefully I will have time to get into that before this summer.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Leah's 9 month checkup was supposed to be last Friday, but on Thursday we took her in for an ear infection.  So we have her hopped up on the Amoxicillin and rescheduled her well visit for this week.

Friday night Tom came over and Leah put on her I have an ear infection and 3 new teeth so I am unhappy show.  I think it scared the poor father to be. We distracted him with Mario party.

Saturday we skipped swimming lessons because of the aforementioned ear infection.

While Kelly was working hard cooking us some dinner, I took baby girl downstairs for some wall-tv an foof action.  Built a little triangle shaped fort out of the couch, giant foof and bench. Leah thought that was crazy fun and worked her cruising skills all around it.  Then she did it.  Out of the blue.  Into the blue.  Took her first steps.  This qualified, it she started it on her own.  She took least three steps, good toddling steps.  After step one she was leaning way off to the side and swung back for the second and by the third she was careening out of control and ate it.  She ate it into the foof, so that was not a problem. At this point I grabbed the baby and started screaming and running around.  On my way up stairs, yelling "Kelly Kelly Kelly!" I became really aware of the fact that Kelly would be disappointed that she wasn't there for the monumentious  event and promptly realized it was too late to not tell her.  So I followed through with the news, and Leah performed for her Mama later on with a few steps in the triangle of foof.

Leah didn't stop there.  Sunday Everett came up to visit and we took him to Lost Dog, while at the café, when Leah was in her high chair he  reached across the table and said "high five!" Leah looked up at his hand for a second then lifted her's and pressed her palm into his.  The three of us went nuts with cheering and atta-girl's to the point where I am pretty sure the rest of the patrons thought we were a little nuts.  I'd say it was a fair assumption.

To prove it we took Leah to the park off of Prosperity Rd--the one with the nice creek. Everett and I threw a Frisbee while Leah and mom played on the swings.  We then wondered down to the creek and the boys climbed on the logs gathering flowers for the baby.  The baby ate rocks.  Everyone had fun.

Last night Kelly grabbed the baby and came downtown so we could take the baby down for a photo op at the cherry blossoms.  While we got a few good pictures, Leah was much more interested in looking at all the crazy things that go on in the city.  There were little kids everywhere they were the most interesting thing ever. I was impressed with her attention span.  And she was happy the entire time.

Pictures to follow.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Our poor little girl.

We took her into the doctor because she had a fever and was clearly feeling bad, and they proceeded to dig a bunch of earwax out only to find she had an ear infection.  The next week we took her back for her well visit, where they poked her with needles (she was extremely well behaved, however).  The next day her face broke out in a rash and was very congested.  You could hear it in her chest.  Fever was back.  We returned to the doc to ask about her rash.  She had another ear infection in her other ear.  What kind of crappy antibiotics was she on for the first one.  The rash turned out to be some sort of Amoxicillin induced virus, which wouldn't have broken out if she had not been on the drugs.  They gave us new antibiotics for her new ear infection and some 'good luck' for the cold and rash.  Oh, it has spread to her arms and legs now.  This has to be the worst thing as a parent ever.  I want to take it away and give it to me.

Our poor little girl.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[This tragedy really hits closer to home than I would have expected.  Kelly and I were talking about why it hits so hard.  I mean, we don't have any tangeable reason to feel so affected. But as Kelly pointed out to me Tech is how we have defined our selves for our entire adult lives. That is where we met, that is where we grew up.  Our prayers for the family's of those who were hurt, and the entire Hokie nation.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Whew, I gotta stay up-to-date with this thing here, because when you fall behind it becomes rather daunting to think about the huge write up that is necessary to bring things up to date.

Well, lets start with a quick recap of recent events.

I spent last week in Austin. Kelly even came out for a while.  The original idea was that I would be there two weeks ago, but out meetings got moved *after* we booked the tickets.  So, we did things in reverse.  She went with me to teas on Friday and returned Sunday with out me.  I have decided that was not the way to do it, our original plan was much better.  You have to bear in mind that this was the first time Kelly was away from Leah overnight.  That's a huge deal for any mother. Honestly, I think she handled it great--but there was a few bumps along the way. I think they can all be attributed to the baby being off her normal routine.  Nobody told me how crucial the baby's routine was going to be.

Got that Tom?  Routine.  Schedule.  They are your friends.

The rest of the week was full of brutal meetings (can I say code audits), and awesome food.  Austin is known for Tex-mex and BBQ.  In heaven I don't plan on eating anything other than Tex-mex and BBQ.  Needless to say I was happy. And in case your wondering I like County Line over Salt Lick.  Both were great, but County Line had a talking cow head on the wall (and ribs that appeared to be from a brontosaur).

I was very happy to finally return home.  I came in the door and the first thing Leah did was walk to me.  She was holding onto the couch and just turned and nearly ran to me. Sure, some might call it a controlled fall, but is was definitely walking. Over the course of this week she has been doing more and more toddling around.  I think the practice outside on the uneven grass has helped, it is much easier to walk on a flat carpet once you have been battling hills, sticks and pine cones.

Since I got back, I've had a new sense of urgency for my work, so I have been pushing hard on that.  Poor C-Dub, I abuse that guy.  Thank God he's there. I meant to go to wushu on Tuesday, but forgot my shoes.  I was going to go yesterday but wound up working till 7. I am feeling fat and inflexible.

Ok, Imma go do the splits.  Cause I am cool like that.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Yes, I am that leet.

Unfortunately, I need to figure where the this dang memory leak is.  Don't mix C, C++, IE and Javascript and expect everything to behave.

So, no Leahtastic update right now, but don't worry it's on my list.  I got some pictures that will flip you out the back of your chair with their cuteness.

In the mean time, django rocks (them judges won't know what hit them).]]></content:encoded>

Pictures of the baby. Now, I may be wrong, and you would rather me drone on and on about wushu nonsense, but I am gonna go with my huntch, and simply leave you with Leah in photo awesomeness form.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Yep, this morning she's your daughter.  Not mine, yours.  I would never behave like she did.

So I put her in the car and detect a slight odor.  I should have gone in and changed her then, but I figured we'd be ok and I wasn't even sure I smelled anything.

When we got to Mrs. Malik's I started putting her shoes on her and definitely smelled a smell.  Pungent.  (Ok, that sounds like she's my daughter, but I never really agreed to that nickname.)  She was getting fidgety (your daughter) and turned herself over in her seat and tried to climb up out of it into the front seats (your daughter).

As she stood up I noticed a rather large brown streak down the back of her darling pink pants.

Not knowing how liquidy said brown mess was I held her very gingerly as I carried her in.

We went straight for the changing mat and I wouldn't let her sit down lest she soil the carpet too.

The brown mess was caked onto her pants and leg.

I cleaned her leg up some and laid her down to change her diaper.

I got the diaper off, I had her mostly cleaned up and then it happened.

She grinned, she grinned first I tell you, and then peed.  Peed on mom.  Or at least near mom.

She soaked her shirt, her sweater and her back.  I'm surprised her hair wasn't wet.

And she was giggling.

I got her clothes off of her and she popped right up and started trying to run around naked.  She was as happy as could be.  Naked and free.

I eventually wrangled her into some clothes and got myself and her super cute clothes cleaned up.

Your. Daughter.

No doubt about it.

It was definitely a more eventful morning than I had planned, but now I'm at work and will be in boring meetings until 4 so I guess I needed some eventfulness.  And that definitely sounds like you.

Well I should run.  And boy, it's taken all sorts of self control to not call you and tell you this.  But I wanted you to sleep.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today Leah, Kelly and I were in the kitchen playin' magnets and doing some dishes.  Leah toddles over to the dishwasher in her normal baby like way and starts licking it.  She turns around and says a few baby-gibberish things to Kelly who simply assumes that the little girl was trying to persuade her to join in the dishwasher licking. So my brilliant wife says "okay!" scoots over and licks the dishwasher too.

I just though that needed be said.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Well I have spent the last two weeks a little under the weather.  I am doing much better now, but it was a little rough for a while.  The doc said that I had some sort of viral sinus infection.  Hooked me up with some pain killers, antibiotics and a decongestant.  I have finished the antibiotics, and am doing much better now.

This past weekend we took Leah for her fist Ikea trip.  She loves shopping, always looking around at all the things to see, wanting to 'get' everything.  Ikea was great as far as she was concerned.  We let her run around and explore, fed her meatballs and potatoes. Well, I should say Kelly fed her those things.  I gave her a fork full of lingdon berries right after we sat down and she made a very sour face and didn't trust me to feed her again for the rest of our meal.

Last week Kelly and I actually got to have a date night.  Grandma came over and swiped the baby from daycare and we had Thursday night to go out.  We went and got tapas at La Tasca in Clarendon, which was made the lady very happy. She loves her some Tapas.  We then went to a quaint little toy store and I bought Leah a book, which I am saving for her birthday.

After that we jumped in the car and headed home. I think we were in bed by 9:30, for sleeping.  We are that Wild. 9:30.

I think we slept for 12 hours. It was awesome.

That next Friday the Tulli came into the city to return our child at M&S grill, but I had to work late and missed most of dinner. They had a spiffy little cubby booth in the back that Leah could run around under the table and look out the window.  I eventually showed up just after dessert with C-Dub and we had a tasty beverage and fun apa-teaser.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I think we finally met our big huge deadline at work.  This doesn’t mean I am not swamped anymore, it does mean that I shouldn’t be working till 1 am every day.  Good news is we pushed hard to make this and when it came time for the important people to decided ‘go or no go’ we got the go.  Score one for the good guys. Of course this project is one of three for this partner, but if you screw up the first one you know you are in bad shape.  I am sure we still have months of wacky requirements for straight forward functionality.

  I did notice yesterday that even though Leah has been sleeping through the night like a champ recently, I am still exhausted.  If the baby don’t keep me up work does.  For father’s day I want  some sleepin’!  That and playing frisbee.   

  I am actually pretty pumped about father’s day. This is my first real one, and I think that is pretty cool.  I’d like to bbq and go play in the park, but I did commit to a wushu demo that happens to take place sometime on Sunday.  Hopefully it is a normal Chinese school thing around 2ish so we can play later on.

  Leah has learned a few more tricks.  I don’t know if I bragged on he waving bye bye yet or not, but she can do that.  She also points and says ‘that’ when you carry her.  She is thrilled if you walk over to ‘that’ for closer inspection.  

  She showed off her smartness earlier this week when Kelly and I went to Aladdin for dinner.  We needed milk, so Kelly ran off to the grocery store and I was supposed to pay the bill and load the little girl in the car. Well, she doesn’t  really like the car (who can blame her, you strap her down and abandon her) and didn’t want to get in.  Once I opened the door to put her in she pointed and said that to <i style="">anything</i><u> </u>that was away from the car.  4 or 5 things, that….that…that…that! I pointed in to the car at her seat and said   ‘How bout that one?” She glared at me for a moment. Then turned her head pointed, said that, and smiled.  I motioned to the care and she made the saddest face and whimpered a bit. I backed up and pointed to a tree, and she smiled, pointed and said  ‘that’. Clearly she didn’t want in the car and was trying to talk me out of it.  Unfortunately, I loaded her up and strapped her down anyway. It was a little sad but we survived.

  Tonight I am going to dinner with my ladies, and we are going to take our sweet time about it.  It will be awesome. Tomorrow I will load my grill into the truck and go be the grillmaster at O-Mei’s open house. Sunday is dad-day, which works out just fine for me.  Holla.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[We went bicycle shopping yesterday, which was great fun.  If you are going to go bike shopping you should take Sean and Nina. Sean was all for it, but we had to sweeten the deal for his woman with some tasty Thai dinner.  Leah apparently had skimped on the naps, but she held up pretty well.  At REI she had plenty to look at, including a pretty pink trike with streamers to ride on, and at the restaurant we had fun stuff to eat.  By the time we got home she was super tired and wanted nothing more than to go to sleep.

  I think I found a bike I want to get Kelly, it is pretty spiffy and Sean and Nina seem to agree that the only problem is it is overkill for our needs.  But if it is overkill and the price is not, you don’t have much of a problem. I may try looking at another shop or two, but I think I may go back and pick up a present for the wife.

  Now I am faced with the problem of what to do about a bike for myself, I have one that I got in Jr High, that was way to big for me then, and I still feel like it is too big for me now.  I would like to strip everything off and have Sean help me rebuild it from the frame up.  I may try hitting up craigslist to see if I can get a little smaller frame.  I plan on looking for one of them baby trailers there anyway.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Leah turned one yesterday and we had the party to prove it.  It was a few weeks of planning on Kelly's part, then there was a couple of days of baking and prepping.  Mostly baking. We baked 4 cakes, carved one into a penguin and added a few few basketfuls of cupcakes just for fun.  Turns out that cake decorating is a really good grip strength exercise.

We were going to do practice cakes on Friday, so Kelly made a quick cake mix into a sheet cake and we carved it out into a penguin and iced it.  Well, he turned out cute, so we decided that we were going to keep him for the party and promptly decreed that no one is to harm the penguin-cake and tucked him away in the fridge.

Saturday we made the Big bear and two little bear cakes and got to icing them up.  It was also when we really had to get the house cleaned up nicely, if anything to make room for all the loot Leah was going to collect.

Sunday was beautiful, we couldn't have asked for a nicer day.  It wasn't oppressively hot, or raining--just nice.  Kelly and I headed down to the lake to setup and get ready, and found Nanjo and Kids there waiting for us. Our picnic area was nice and shady, with a polite breeze.  We filled balloons, and set up table clothes and waited for Grandma to bring the birthday girl. Leah was pretty happy, I thought she would be in a better mood, but she wasn't unhappy by any means.  She didn't mind people holding her (except Todd) and was more than happy eating her little cake.  However, she didn't do face first dive into it, to my dismay.

I think all the kids had a good time--Everett, Neal and I played Frisbee with the older kids for bit.  There was plenty of playground to handle the pandemonium.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I think I like it.  Way less stress.  I had fun cheering for my teammates and showing off my Daughter to all our wushu friends.  It’s sorta crazy how extended the extended wushu circle goes.  I just wish I got to see them more often than every other year.

Everyone did a really good job this weekend.  We got a brand new set of faces on the team, at least for the men. I think the mean age is something like 10 years old, but them lil kids are crazy good.  Jessica and I held the ceremonious passing of the number one, to Colvin and Sarah.  I very happy we could keep it in the family.  They really deserve their spots, they tore it up.

I wound up doing the official score calculations for the tournament.  Talk about an annoying job.  We need these things entered into a relational database and have it crunch the numbers.  It was just a little too complicated for excel.  I was very paranoid I was going to fat finger the scores and screw up the standings.  The good news is I have gone back a few times over the numbers and so far so good.  But it was nice to be able to sit down with the actual judges score sheets and verify that all the numbers added up correctly.  After hearing all the rumors over and over I was very careful to look for anything suspicious, but by the end of the day everything seemed in order. Oh thank God.

I thought this was hands down the best run wushu tournament I had been do, it actually started when they said it would – the judges lunch break didn’t transform into a 3 hour siesta – and the venue actually fit the number of competitors.  Heck, they even had air conditioning, albeit a little too much AC, but they had it.

I now feel very out of shape, and need to go stretch.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I know this because she has taken to walking around only on her tippy toes.  That, and she likes to climb.  She is a mini Sherpa. Which is impressive because Sherpas are quite small.  I even had a lady comment that leah was just learning to walk because "look how she walks on her toes."  That just proves that ladies can be pretty dumb. Take that toe-lady.

Last night we had a big accomplishment, followed by a bit of despair on our part.  Leah figured out how to eat with a fork. She took an empty fork, speared a piece of tilapia piccata, and stuck it in her mouth. We cheered. She continued fumble around with the fork, occasionally getting more food, but mostly getting food close to her mouth before knocking it off the fork. The despair kicked in when we noticed she wouldn’t let us feed her, she had to feed herself.  Moreover, she wouldn’t use her hand to pickup the food either, she was all about the flat ware. Eating took a long, long time.  Luckily, Kelly figured out how to sneak in a few bites when Leah brought an empty fork to her mouth.   Sure, it sped up dinner that night, but it might be reinforcing bad fork skills with tasty fish reward.
Parenting is hard.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Ride down:  Well it didn’t start out so smoothly.  Work exploded so Kelly & Leah went home to pack on their own and pick me up on the way out of town.  Leah apparently wasn’t thrilled with this idea and has to get a playmate from down the street to distract her as Kelly packed.  Then the ladies swooped in and picked me up.  A quick dinner at Baja and we were on our way.  The little girl was asleep before we hit 81 (and nearly hit a cayote).  Things went fine for a while until we hit traffic and Leah woke up.  She cried for 20 minutes or so while we pretended not to be there and eventually went back to sleep.  We arrived at our hotel at 12:30am and there was a line to check in.  We all got into bed and were happy to be near The Promised Land.

Friday we got up and Kelly had a stupid meeting on her stupid phone.  So Leah and I decided to go to Walmart to play for a bit.  But we got lost.  They seem to have installed a dozen or so overpasses for no apparent reason.  However, as a side benefit we discovered that nice part of Christiansburg – The Toy Station, antique shops, The Chocolate Spike, Dude’s Drive In and Due South BBQ.

Our adventures (and the less than normal night’s sleep) had tuckered out the little girl so we went back to the hotel for naps.  Despite being exhausted Leah fought going to sleep and stood up in the Pack-N-Play looking around.  Kelly & I had to dive onto the floor and army-crawl behind  the bed so Leah couldn’t see us.  Once Leah was asleep we moved to the bed and the three of us slept soundly for three hours!  We all felt like new people when we woke up.  And hungry people.  Our dilemma: where to eat lunch.  I told Kelly about Due South and she agreed that we should check it out – after all, the baby is a fan of BBQ.

<img class="picture" src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/blog/image/595/IMG_2519.JPG">

Due South was great.  The food was awesome and Leah rocked out to bluegrass.  The only problem was that it wasn’t a nostalgic place for us.  We decided that we should go there lots so that we could make it a nostalgic place and go there every time we’re in town.

<img class="picture" src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/blog/image/595/IMG_2521.JPG">

From there we headed to the main event – Blacksburg.  Kelly was getting nervous as we got closer and closer to town – it might not like her anymore – and all our driving around to find a good parking spot was just making it worse.  Eventually we said any spot will do and got out to breathe Blacksburg air.  We wandered around Steppin’ Out looking at all the booths and telling Leah things like “That’s where Daddy used to get his hair cut,” or “Mommy once sat on that bench eating ice cream in the winter.”  The only thing we bought from one of the vendors (if you don’t count the tasty limeade) was a knit hat for Leah and headed off for the air conditioned book store to do some real buying.

<img class="picture" src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/blog/image/595/IMG_2584.JPG">

Kelly has wanted to get Leah a cheerleader outfit all summer so she made a beeline for the baby section.   We picked up half a dozen other shirts and a few little trinkets but not nearly as much as we anticipated.  There were no “Hokies United” shirts and they won’t have more in until the end of the month.  We could enter a raffle at Steppin’ Out but I think we’ll just order some when they’re back in stock.  Man I wanted one of those shirts.  We then proceeded to hit up every Tech paraphernalia store between there and our car.  But not before spending some quality time on the Drill field since we had to introduce Leah to Kelly’s tree.  Kelly and I just sat for a while and Leah ran around picking up leaves and whatnot.

<img class="picture" src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/blog/image/595/IMG_2579.JPG">

Once it became clear that Leah needed to get a nap we headed back to the hotel.  Unfortunately the baby fell asleep in the car and we didn’t have the heart to mover her.  So we sat in the car.  She woke up after about an hour and we were off to dinner.  We’d already decided we were going to Bogen’s.   I was a little ethrown off, because the menu no longer looked like a monopoly board, but the food was still tasty.

We headed back to the hotel and proceeded to prep the baby for bed. She was clearly tired, and we figured she would go to sleep quick and easy.  We were wrong and wrong. I walked her. Kelly walked her. She was wired.  This went on for a couple of hours. The elaborate forts we built to shield the us from Leah’s view went down, as we were just too tired to deal with them (and if we were gonna go to sleep right away, there was no point). If we were at home we would have put her in her crib and let to put herself to sleep, but we couldn’t do that in the hotel  -- especially after we found that she liked to entertain herself by banging on the walls.

Around 11 she was finally out, and so were we.  Up early and armed with the knowledge that we were going to be kicked out of the hotel by 1, we set out to make Leah as tired as possible so she could have an early nap. We did what any good parent visiting Blacksburg would do. Head to the toy department at Wal-mart.  We also fit in a tasty breakfast at Cracker Barrel, with grits galore—but then it was back to the room for a nap.

We were smart and hung the DND tag on the door handle. Leah cooperated and crashed for us. We slept too. The house keeping lady banged on the door a little after noon. I opened the door and said no thanks. That woke up the baby and we were up for good. I’ll get you eh house keeping!

But we packed and loaded up the car and hit up Macado’s for lunch before the trip to the duck pond. We fed them our left over crusts from lunch and half a grilled cheese sandwich. Them ducks, they loved it.  We even found a mama duck with a dozen fluffy yellow babies, and since they were babies Leah shared her stars. They didn’t eat them. I think they were too little to eat the stars.  Poor ducklings, stars are good.

As we were headed into campus to make our way back to main street Kelly and I decided we were just too exhausted to last the rest of the day and headed back to the car to journey northward. We wound up skipping the home place, but it was the right call. We’s was tired.

<img class="picture" src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/blog/image/595/IMG_2615.JPG">

Leah did great for the first few hours in the car.  She was awake and mostly happy – eventually dozed off for about an hour.  She came to about the time we hit I-66 and decided she had enough of that stupid car seat and wanted out. So she screamed. A lot.

We had this theory that she was hungry and wanted to run around for a bit.  So we asked tom tom for suggestions and he lead us to Old Carolina Smokehouse in Hay marked VA – which was awesome. Leah didn’t want to eat or run around. She just wanted to not go back in her seat. So we ate and put her back in her seat. She screamed for most of the 45 mins home – which was not awesome.

Back at Ft. Truxion little miss was as happy as could be. Running around with her new orange and maroon pom poms, flogging the cats. Giggling.]]></content:encoded>

<title>Leah is more fun than programming</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I know I have been really bad about about keeping up with my blog.  In the past I would make long senseless posts about wushu between the fun adventure posts.  Well, since I haven’t been doing much of that (and when I do I mostly just work basics and get sore), I don’t have that stuff to post about.  Now, there are more adventures, nearly all inspired or caused my the little miss, but work has been nuts so I am falling behind on them.

I could replace the wushu posts with programming posts, but I am not sure that is what my audience (read: Kelly) wants to read about. Not that they wanted to read about wushu, but it was an easy topic that was constantly on my mind. So now that programming is my idée fixe I figured maybe I should write about that. So here goes:
I just spend the last few days trying to figure out some weird C Runtime Library (CRT) issues with our new installer.  We had always built things as multithreaded, not multithreaded dll, so it was never a problem. We would much rather have larger exe’s than to redistribute the msvc dlls.  Well, turns out that you can’t build  C++/CLI mixed mode code as multithreaded, so you have to dynamically link to the CRT if you want to build with /cli.  Drat. I just want to statically link and be done with it.  This was annoying because I didn’t notice until after I deployed on a machine with out the Visual Studio installed, and it would crash hard and give me this fancy FileNotFound error.  I read all about manifests and how to embed them, but Visual Studio’s linker automatically does that for me – eventually I figured out that we were trying to use the redist dll’s from VS2005, but built out lib with VS2005sp1!  Egads!  Now that I have the correct version of the dlls, I think we are in business.

And that’s why they call them business socks.

Hmm, maybe, I shouldn’t write about that stuff – and if I want to I will need to make the articles useful, and that takes lot of time.  Plus my audience really just wants to hear A) Stories about Leah B) Funny stories or C) Funny stories about Leah.

They would prolly love to hear about how Leah got my wallet, emptied it’s contents, stuck the post-it’s on her belly and handed me the empty shell with a big grin on her face. I think she hid one of my credit cards. Hopefully this is not foreshadowing.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[This was Leah's second plane trip, and last time we bought her a seat and her grandma came along to help out. Unfortunately we didn't luck out enough to get a row to ourselves, and had to share space with some poor unsuspecting traveler. The flight out she never really cried, but was a little fussy and very fidgety the entire trip.  The way back she was very sleepy and cranky, but after a tour standing up at the front of coach dad was able to trick her into sleeping. Despite the evil glares from a business man (who had an empty seat next to him). And Kelly and I (and the poor lady in our row) had a couple hours of still and quite.
<img class="picture" src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/blog/image/595/IMG_2811.JPG" />

When we landed early in Denver, early enough that jeannie had not even left the her house in Colorado Springs yet, and was gonna be a while.  So we gathered all our babies and baby related stuff and set out to find a place we could let Leah get down and run.  And run she did. It was way past her bedtime, and she was hyper like only a hyper one year old can be. We were running around a column playing 'catch the baby which eventually blossomed into a proper game of hide and seek.  I would take her to the corner and tell her to count to 3, then count with her while trying prevent her from peeking. then run off a few feet away and 'hide' by the wall, or behind some of our luggage. Once we got into it she was playing along good.  So much so that I overheard passers by saying "oh, look! she's counting" while she had her head buried in the corner with a "du...du...du." our games involved lots of running, flailing and screeching.  Impressive thing is, she didn't even crash right away in the car, she lasted a good 30 minutes.

<img class="picture" src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/blog/image/595/IMG_2879.JPG" />

One best parts of visiting the McPenberthy's at Monopuss Manor, are the Dogs. We would sit out back and throw a ball for hours.  In addition to the fun puppies to entertain Leah (and her dad), the weather was gorgeous, no humidity and no bugs. Dirk, Jeannie and Kelly kept making these amazing meals that we could eat on the back patio. Strap the baby into her chair and we could chow down on Alaskan Salmon, King Crab and Stuffed Blueberry French Toast Croissants. I think I gained a few pounds. Which is not surprising considering how many pounds of Fondue I ate.

Leah's favorite backyard activity must have been collecting rocks. Dirk and I took her out behind the back yard so that he could run the dogs a bit more, and she started picking up rocks as best she could and when he noticed that she could only carry three at a time, Dirk set out to get her a pail. Turns out a Tupperware bowl is a lot like a pail.  Especially when filled with rocks. From then on, we where in serious rock collecting mode. So the rock beds all around the edge of Monopuss Manor were really handy.

We didn't say at their house the entire time, though I would have been happy to hang out there -- between the back yard, the dogs and FotC on OnDemand, I really didn't want to leave.  However, we were in CO, and there were fun things to go do. And we did a few.

<img class="picture" src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/blog/image/595/IMG_3007.JPG" />

First one was the Air Force Academy.  Which is across the street from their place. Kelly and I being a couple of AF brats, we had a good time.  Checked out the Chapel and looked at a few planes on display.  Pretty fancy campus.  We went from there to the Olympic Training center and wondered around. We were there late so they didn't have any tours still, but Leah had a good time running around in the little courtyard.

<img class="picture" src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/blog/image/595/IMG_3069.JPG" />

The highlight of our excursions had to be the Zoo. We went to the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo, which was a really fun little place.  Little miss was pretty overwhelmed while we were there, but was also very interested in everything.  She was clearly tired but never got fussy.  Just went hard until she crashed in her stroller.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img class="picture" src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/italy_2007/image/595/Italy+2007+131.JPG" />

Now that we are home and I can look back on the trip, Cinque Terre was probably the highlight. We showed took the train from Florence, a quick stop over in Piza for a leaning batido, and continued on to Monterosso.  As we were getting close the train would pop out of a tunnel for a split second and give us a glimpse of the Med, with a bright sunny sky and the turquoise sea, and then disappear again. Even when got to the little village we were stunned by the view.  Gorgeous beach, sail boats and pastel Italian buildings.

<img class="picture" src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/italy_2007/image/595/Italy+2007+083.JPG" />

We didn't waste much time there, though we probably should have, but we set out to find the trail.  The guidebook told us of two trails, Trail 1, which was easy; and Trail 2, which more scenic but much harder. We wanted trail 1.  We didn't find it. But we had a beautiful hike. A beautifully hard hike with a full pack. We basically scaled up and down the coastal mountains through vineyards and lemon orchards. Occasionally we would be blessed with a fairly level stretch, but that was pretty rare. The number of stairs was out of control. But as we wound around the mountains that jutted into the sea we could see the little village we were headed to, and turn and look back to the shrinking town we left.

<img class="picture" src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/italy_2007/image/595/Italy+2007+149.JPG" />

Aside from the view, the best part of the trip was the magical hole in a fence on a very steep stair climb about half way between the two villages. It was magical because for the bargain price of 2 euro, you could get fresh lemonade from fresh lemons. It was squeezed on the spot by what appeared to be a football hooligan. The only problem was the group of Italians in front of me (and eventually a nice British couple, who queued up behind me). I had the girls climb up a bit so they could sit and wait while I stood in line.  Unfortunately there was a very chatty guy and his 5 or 6 best friends (many of whom were shirtless, yet appeared to be wearing a sweater). I didn't mind waiting for them all to get their drinks, but as their friends showed up, they too got in on the action, then the first few wanted refills.  It was a little frustrating, especially when one of the younger fellas was pointing out that there were people waiting for some precious lemon flavored sugar water. Eventually I did score the drinks and brought them back up to the girls. Where, it turns out, we were a bit too winded to really enjoy them.

According to Kelly, the hike lasted about an hour and a half.  Clearly all the climbing went to her head, it was easily five times that.

When we did get to Vernazza we were able to find a little pizzeria with an unobstructed view of the sunset and some of the best pesto ever made. It was over this pesto that we discussed the merits of taking the train to the next town--which contained our hotel for the night.

<img class="picture" src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/italy_2007/image/595/Italy+2007+156.JPG" />

Corniglia was not as much fun as Vernazza, that was mostly due to two little reasons: 1) It was not down on the sea, but up on a cliff overlooking it and 2) There were 368 stairs between the town and the train station.

<img class="picture" src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/italy_2007/image/595/Italy+2007+183.JPG" />

We eventually found our hotel there. We did this by going to a resturant with the same name, asking the waitress who instructed us to follow her, hike back into the center of town and back into one of the stacked buildings there.

The next morning we discussed continuing the hike, but wussed out and took the train. We were sore. Oh, and the strep I gave Kelly was really kicking in at that point.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Getting to and from work has been a little frustrating the last couple of days. Maybe I am a little sensitive because I am writing this on the bus, but not the bus I wanted to catch.  I got to see that one pull away as I ran up to the stop.  Nope, the one that shows up 20 min after that.

Today wasn't too bad. Yesterday was the real debacle. I tried to take the bus in, and apparently I missed it.  I know the time it comes into the neighbourhood, and I was at the stop at that time, but it must have been ahead of schedule, cause it never showed.  So I waited in the shelter, since it was raining. The next bus rolls past, and stops a little after the stop.  So I run over and hop in. The driver scolds me for standing in the shelter "just cause you can see me doesn't mean I can see you." I apologize and go sit in the back. 20 minutes into the ride I notice we don't get on the freeway. It hits me, I got on the local bus.  I swear it said "express," but it wasn't.  I was on the 17A.  Burke to the Pentagon via Landmark Mall. ugh. Eventually I get there, hop off and have the nice walk from Navy Memorial to the office.

That evening Sean and Nina were coming over, and I thought I would be sneaky and bum a ride so I could skip the bus. I walk out the door only a few minutes late, pretty happy.  I get down to the platform to find it mobbed. The board says there are residual delays.  It took longer than normal but we get on the first orange line train that comes to the platform. And all was looking good until the operator couldn't work the doors anymore. By the time we got to Foggy Bottom (the last stop in the district) we had to deboard the train.  Now that platform was pressed-up-against-strangers packed. And we watched as packed train after packed train showed up to take 2, 3 people away. One of them even contained C-Dub who silently mocked me. After this happened 6 or 7 times I hop on the train going the other direction and get on there.  It seemed pretty quick. As soon as I got to Farragut West I was able to run and get on an orange line train immediately. However by the time I got back to Foggy Bottom the platform was empty and it was very easy to get on the train I was on.

Luckily when I finally did get there Sean and Nina were still waiting. And we embarked in a whirlwind drive though Arlington in a lil pickup with 2 and a half seats.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Ok, so I wasted a good part of thanksgiving day trying to get vim workign again on vista.  I am not sure what happened, but it went nuts.  It may have been the recent windows updates or the face that I in stalled .NET 3.5, but it was unusable.  None of the plugins/syntax highlighting/menus that I have grown to love.  So here is what I did:

Vim on Vista

Installed gvim71-2.exe to C:\vim ([from here](http://hasno.info/2007/5/18/windows-vim-7-1-2))

Copy the folling files into C:\vim\vim71\
<ul><li>iconv.dll ([from here](http://sourceforge.net/projects/gettext) You can find the dll file in the bin directory of the "libiconv-win32" archive.)</li><li>libintl.dll ([from here](http://sourceforge.net/projects/gettext) Get "intl.dll" from the bin directory in the gettext-win32 archive and store it as "libintl.dll" in the same directory as gvim.exe, overwriting the file that may already be there.)</li><li>gvimext.dll ([from here](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1720))
</li></ul>Here is the thing that stuck me for hours, if you had previously installed vim
to the recommended location of C:\Program Files you won't be able to associate
files with the new location until you edit the registry.  Go to:
<blockquote>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Applications\gvim.exe
</blockquote>Make sure the edit\command and open\command Keys have the following default value:
<blockquote>C:\vim\vim71\gvim.exe "%1"
</blockquote>If you want the  "Edit with vim" in windows explorer:
<ul><li> Run C:\vim\vim71\install.exe</li><li>Choose no when asked if you want to uninstall, then enter "d 14"</li></ul>If you get a gvim not in your path error with the "Edit with vim" shell ext, make sure you don't have gvim.exe set to run as Administrator, as that will break it.

If you don't want to run around and get those files, you can download them [here](http://www.blogger.com/files/vimvista.zip).

Also, I added my suite of vim files [here](http://www.blogger.com/files/vimfiles.zip).]]></content:encoded>

<title>Tired of your mop?</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[You should try mopping the inside of the oven while you are baking a cake.

Kelly decided to make a new exciting cake for my birthday, something she had never made before. I remember that she even noted that it looked like it was going to be more batter than the pans could hold.  Apparently she dismissed that because maybe the cake was really dense.  She should have listened to her instincts.

Once we got the baby down, and the cake in the oven Kelly and I were going to hang out in the basement.  Well, I ran up to grab something and noticed that smoke was rising out of the oven.  I cracked it open to have a look and was slammed in the face with an eye-stinging cloud of smoke.  I noticed the cake was bubbling up and out of the pans. Immediately I ran up and popped the battery out of the smoke detector so that didn't wake up the baby, and returned to investigate solutions to our smoke problems.  I noticed that the cake that was still in the pan was just fine, that all the smoke was emanating from the batter that was setting on the floor of the oven.  So I did what any guy would do. Soak a towel in cold water and strap it to the end of a broom handle and try to mop it up.  Well, a towel rubber-banded to a stick makes a poor mop, and as I furiously la-na-za'd the bottom of the oven, there should be a commercial product that would enabled better mopping.  But wait, a mop!

I grabbed our little sponge mop, soaked it up and started pushing the batter around on the bottom of the oven.  Not something that really cleaned up the oven, it was more of a move-the-mess-around type activity.  By the time I had established my process, Kelly finally got tired of shouting "what are you doing?" and came up to investigate.

Once she got over the initial confusion, she had the idea that we should take the half baked cake out of the oven and try to finish up the job. I concurred. At this point we took the sloshy cakes out and turned off the oven.  Once we had the oven shelves out my process worked much better.

Once we were done we decided that we should at least try to finish baking the cake, so we popped it back in the oven.  A little while later we discovered that twice baked cake is not nearly as good as twice baked potatoes.

My birthday cake this year was smores. I am not complaining.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I have been running round like crazy at work and getting ready for the holidays, that I entirely forgot that it is gonna be Christmas.  Still sorta feel like it is a week or two away.

Work has been alittle nuts because I am doing some last minute stuff for a lil networking company that wants neat stuff to show off at the CES.  I am pretty pumped about the show, especially now that we are bringing more people and staying on the strip, but find it a little frustrating that they all get free trips (i.e. they don’t have to do any panic coding for bipolar partners FOR the show).  The bad part about the panicked coding is that I had to wrap up my real work so that I could get to it.

Now I need to get good at Ruby fast (which is actually a little frustrating because I am finally comfortable in Python).  Oh, and enforce deployment processes.  Strike that, automated deployment process. The Doc is the testing nazi, I the equivalent for version control, and it looks like I get to be it for deployment too. I don’t want that job.

Kelly got what appears to be a stomach bug, and has been pretty weak – so much so that we had to send little miss to grandma’s so that she could rest.  Poor girl got hit with it as soon as her vacation started.  Fortunately we are starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel now, she woke up feeling much better.  Then felt worse, but not nearly as bad, and, the best part, ate an entire meal for breakfast.  Yay for pamcakes!

Beej and Katie (and Maggie and Luke) also came out for breakfast, where we exchanged presents and set up plans for some new years boringness. Which from the sound of it the Eshlers will get to partake in.  It was awesome hanging out and talking after we ate.  Mags and Luke were so quiet and happy the entire time and we had lots to talk about (read: babies and electronics).

Well, everyone is down for a nap, I am wired from a half dozen cups of coffee and gonna go read Why the Lucky Stiff for a bit.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Leah and I just finished playing a nice round of sock-mouth

Sock mouth dates back to yesterday when we were eating some eggs for dinner.  One of the bigger bits of eggs was still too hot when she put it in her mouth.  so she spit it out and gave it a very suspicious look. You know one of those, how could you do that to me type looks. Well to make her feel better I treated that bit as if it were gross.  I pushed it away and said yuck.  She thought this was great.  So she pushed it away too, I grabbed her hand and said yucky yuck! and the game was born.

At least the game of yucky eggs.

Tonight when I went to change her diaper she was very sad to be leaving the couch so I tried to cheer her up.  She gave me the idea when she took off her sock and handed it to me.  I shook it and said yuck, made a face and set it on the table next to her.  She immediately associated the face and word yuck with the egg game and thus sock-mouth was born.

She tries to put the sock in her mouth and I make faces.  She tries to put the sock in my mouth and I make faces. Then we run around squealing.

If it is a game, then there must be some way to win.  I had to turn to Leah for inspiration on this one. But she sure found the definitive win condition.

First one to vomit wins. Shove a sock into your mouth till you throw up 2 fish sticks.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Guest post by Kelly

So, at a little more than 18 months I think we're starting to see both a very independent streak appear in Leah, right on schedule, as well as some other behaviors I wasn't quite ready for yet.

The little girl seems to be loathe to accept help from her parents on just about anything these days, unless it is to use our bodies as a step stool.  One of the most poignant examples of this happened Monday night.  We had just returned home and I caught a whiff of some pants that needed changing.  At the same time Leah wandered over to her diaper bag and pulled out the changing pad.  She proceeded to set down the pad sort of in front of me and lied down.  When I tried to adjust the pad to be right in front of me I was showered with a chorus of "No, no, no!" and giggles.  We repeated this almost a dozen times, sometimes trying to adjust the pad's position in relation to me, sometimes trying to adjust Leah's position in relation to the pad, but all attempts to alter Leah's chosen configuration resulted in "No, no, no!"  I eventually decided that I am the parent and we'll do things my way and wisked her off to the changing table to do things right.  Much less laughing and much more pouting.  (Man it sucks to be the responsible one sometimes.)

Leah is also showing a lot of maternal instincts with her dolls.  She holds them, feeds them, "changes their diapers", pats them on the back, etc.  Monday night she also took to educating them.  As she was reading "That's Not My Dinosaur" she would "read" the page and then take the dolls hand and put it on the touch & feel part of the page.  Ta-adorable!

Lastly, Leah is becoming her Dad.  At least in the mornings.  Two days ago when she woke up after coming to our bed she stretched, looked around, crawled over to the bedside table, turned off the light, and curled back up with her eyes closed.  Clearly, it was too bright and she was trying to sleep.  Geez mom!  This morning she just kept shifting from one side to the other and curled back up in a little ball at every attempt to waken her.  It probably didn't help that Dad was curled up right next to her and soundly sleeping too, but she was determined to sleep.  I thought we'd have until she was a teenager to have to pry her out of bed but I guess when you adore Dad you pick up his habits early.]]></content:encoded>

<title>Wait a second, what happened to January?</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I am nto sure what happened to january.  I think I remember christmas, and I know there was CES, but I think that was just the other day.  Now my computer is telling me it is time we start thinking about February.  Who knew!

I have been talking every last second of my free time to geek out on rails recently.  One of our prestigious swapfriends is in town and I am stealing every bit of knowledge I possibly can while he is trying to do real work.  It is working.  I am learning alot.  Of course this process leads to me reading/coding on the train, bus, at work, over lunch and at night when I should be sleeping. Heck I even tricked people into staying after work to "ya know, hang out and code".  It worked. Yes, I asked people to volunteer to stay and continue to work after work.  They did. Sure some bailed once the pizza was gone, and a few more after a couple of beers, but we have a few rock out to the dev-tunes.

Anytime I am not squandering away with work is family time.  I need to make sure to keep the family time top priority, because things are starting to slip, and I see it getting cut.  But it is still top in my mind.  And Leah and really become alot of fun.  She can really play now. Proper little kid playing. Make believe, rough housing, dancin', the works.

I cannot believe how surprised I am every time she shows her abstract abilities.  A few of thing things I am the most impressed with are: Language comprehension (she can't say it, but she knows what the elephant is, and how to find the matching shoe when you ask), imagination (changing dolly's diaper, dressing up like mom), and trying to manipulate her parents (Yeah, I normally see though it, I just sometimes let it happen -- it is just easier).  I am sure all parents out there are equally astonished, but can't understand how abstract thought can be learned, but I am watching it happen right in front of my eyes.  Teh cool.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[What happens when you have 4 engineers gather for a tasty dinner?
<img src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/blog/image/595/IMG_5616.JPG" class="picture" />
Pyrotechnics on a micro level.

I just spent the evening with a fully geeked out nerd fest, and it was a blast.

Kelly, Danny, Chris and I built match stick rockets.

Chris took the early lead with an impressive 12'10" flight, which he shortly topped with 13'4" jump.  Danny stuck with the more experimental designs, but his gamble didn't pay off, he had a mere 3 flights that got him off the table.  I was able to manage one or two extra-table launches, but was getting no where until Kelly said she would pledge her undying love to the winner and this was my last attempt.  Well, not willing to let the mother of my child go to another Chris, I wrapped the foil extra tight and had set the launch angle extra low.  No one beleived it.  19'1" and I get to keep my Wife's love.  Huzzah!

Next up, Caps robots.]]></content:encoded>

<title>Added a Trac-Hack</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/blog/image/595/RistoInk1-766603.png" border="0" class="picture" />

I heart trac, and I also heart VibrantInk, as well as my VibrantInk-based color scheme for Vim and Visual Studio.

Earlier this week I spent a little time making a few tweaks to the css of Trac, and was able to get the code browser to show up in my beloved color scheme.  After walking around all proud of my self, but everyone I told was more or less utterly unimpressed.  So I decided to do the selfless thing and brag about it to the Trac community.  Thus the [VibrantInkCodeTheme](http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/VibrantInkCodeTheme) was born.

My visual studio scheme is form John Lam's settings with a few minor tweaks
My vim scheme is based the VividChalk theme by Tim Pope.  I've done a fair amount of work on this one, making it work under gVim, Windows CMD, gnome-terminal and the Mac Terminal. The tri-platform thing was a bit of a pain.  Every time i got it just right under two of the three, it would break on the third. Seriously, you'd think in the year 2008 we could get at least 256 colors in *all* the terminals.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I've been doing a bunch of interviews for programmers these days. I have been elected the phone screen guy, so whenever we get a new resume from the recruiter I get to give them a call to see if they are worth bringing in.  Alot of them are not.

I have made a few rules for interviews.  If any of these rules are broken, I promptly thank them for their time and get off the phone, otherwise I would simply be getting their hopes up.

Rule 1: Do not beg.

I don't care how much you want the job, begging don't help. Especially if you are under-qualified for the position.

Rule 2: Answer the question asked.

Seriously, I like when people say "I don't know," if you ramble off in an unrelated direction, I just get annoyed.

I am going to start writing down quotes.  Here is a quick excerpt from a recent phone call:

Me: What is the difference between recursion and iteration?
Them: Oh, well, recursion, yeah I had a project that really needed that and I was going to implement it last year, but I didn't get a chance to.

Later in that call:

Me: Can you name a few design patterns?
Them: Um, sure.  Creator .... Polymorphism .... Protected.

I am sure there are plenty of rules where those came from.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[We have passed the halfway mark of the great Leah famine of 2008.

Just in case you don't know, Leah went to Texas with her Grandmother who wanted to take her to see the bluebonnets and visit family.  I thought this would be a great time to get a lot of stuff done around the house, Kelly thought this would be a good time to go insane.  Now that is probably the good and healthy for a mother who's baby girl changed time zones with out her.

As I mentioned, I was hoping to get a bunch of stuff done, but the preceding weeks have been a little rough and we are mostly using the time to rest, recover and spend quality toddler free time with the wife.  My goal has shifted from getting Leah's new room cleared out to eating out at nice places and going to the movies. If it hadn't been for the stairway-to-debacle project or the surprise trip to Austin i'm sure plenty of progress would have been made on little miss's new room, but I'll take what I can get.

Aside from the phone call's from Kelly's mom about the massive deviations from Leah's normal schedule and the news of a fever, we are handling this pretty well.  She will return home on Wednesday, and there is no way that either of us will stay home from the airport.  However, I am a little scared to get between Leah and her Mom when they are fresh off the plane, least Leah choose to come to me first.  I would not want to suffer the consequences if that were to happen. And there would be consequences.

We did go downtown for brunch today, but it was wet and dreary so we decided to skip the walk around the tidal basin for the Cherry Blossoms. A bit of a bummer, but Kelly got the pedicure and I got to hang in the coffee shop and play on the MBP.

I think we are going to finish off the weekend nice and easy:  Kelly has a book, I am playin' rails, and maybe some wings for dinner.

Anyone want some wings?]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I really think fuzzymonk.com is way over due for an update, something to simplify things, but don't think I am going to get any time to deal with that any time soon.  Would really like to migrate the cookbook and dictionary to rails.  Would be stupid easy.

We just got back from Colin Hay.  Was our second time seeing him at the Birchmere, he was every bit as good as he was last time.  We even had an extra ticket so were able to drag my esteemed colleague from the west out.  I think everyone had a good time, nice chill show with some funny enter-song commentary.

I think the best part of the evening was coming home to and having our delightful babysitter, Mer, tell us how wonderful our daughter is.  We always worry she won't be good for other people, if for no other reason because we want them to come back and babysit again.  But our worries were for nothing, and she was sweet as could be.  Apparently liberal with the kisses and hugs, as well as easily entertained and didn't mind going to bed.  Score one for the little Sexton girl.

Oh, that silly girl:

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Guest Post by Kelly

So, we're all pretty tired today after being out late last night for Colin Hay and we have to get up and out early tomorrow for one of my wonderful pregnancy mandated tests so we were talking about going to bed early.  We even got Little Miss down a good 30 minutes before normal and were finishing our prep for a quick exit in the morning.

But then I suspected that Chris didn't really want to go to bed so I had to save him from himself and find a plan that would keep him up, and ideally work him up so that he wouldn't be able to sleep even once he finished dealing with whatever scheme I came up with.  So like a good wife, I thought and thought for a few minutes and then settled on a brilliant plan.

Drywall.  Plumbing.  Ceiling.  Leaks.

What more could a guy ask for?

Currently Chris is standing on step stool, cutting holes in our ceiling and occasionally asks for more buckets or towels.  You see, about a week ago we discovered that our toilet was leaking so Chris turned off the water and drained it and planned to fix it when he had a moment to breathe.  Then sometime between Friday and today the water got turned back on and left on so the toilet kept on leaking.  Right into our living room ceiling.  We're hoping that one sheet of drywall will be big enough to replace everything he's tearing down right now.

So, any of you project-savvy blog readers who are just itching for a home project to work on, have we got a fun one for you!

At least we've scored some tupperware, a grocery bag, and some assorted crap that we found between the ceiling and flooring.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[It hasn't been the best week.  The pollen count has been crazy high, so my allergies have been going crazy.  I think this lead to some sort of infection, one that thought it would be fun to make me unable to open my eyes in the morning.  Not conjunctivitis, iv'e had that, that'd be worse, this is just a little insult over the cough and congestion that is normally associated with this season.  To top it all off I seem to have lost my normal speaking voice, in its place I have this raspy thing that likes to crack and squeak a lot.  Especially when I am trying to talk to my little miss.  You can't say "beep-beep" at all like this.  Really can pull the fun out of playing.

[Wow, vim takes nearly 30 seconds to look up conjunctivitis with spell check]

So the house has been as problematic as my sinuses.  Once we finally got fed up with the stair contractors and paid them to leave an unfinished job, the upstairs toilet decided it didn't like to hold all that water in the tank and let it drip on the floor.  The tile floor, in an amazing delegation effort decided that it too was not going to be burdened with the wet stuff, and passed it on down. The living room ceiling really tried to hold it up, but it was just poorly equipped for the job.  So I got to spend last weekend ripping it down (I guess I punished it for not doing a job it was not designed to do, oh well), and replacing it.  Drywall is just the sort of thing a severe allergy suffer loves. Monday the wife discovers that the power room toilet was constantly running, and quietly turned off the water and decided to spare me until I was in a better place.  Apparently work is a better place, cause she told me on the phone while I was there.  Luckily it was a pretty easy fix, and has yet figured out how to cause more damage.  While it was an easy battle, it was a battle non-the-less.  And I am tired and don't want to play plumbing any more.

[I have been on the platform for about 20 min, and still no estimate when the next train will be here, sure it's 1 in the afternoon, but I need me a train]

I think the other thing that's really a bummer is the house prices in Burke.  Of course I knew they dropped, but didn't think they had gotten as low as they have.  We were in the lucky 5% of Fairfax that the assessed value didn't fall, but everything in the neighbourhood seems to be selling for less than that.  Kinda takes the fun out of home projects if the value is drooping.

Work has come up with a bit of fun, we have decided to hold a programming contest, complete with an alluring prize.  I felt pretty cool when everyone decided that I was the favorite to win and as such a number of people have asked to team up.  I am pretty excited about how competitive people have gotten while remaining helpful.  Everybody shares their ideas and the competitors will even offer advice on how to get those ideas to work. It really shows how cool the engineers are at the company.

We will see if everyone can continue to play nice together (this is a gentleman's game, after all) and if the power-that-be are happy with the results--maybe we can do it again.

My biggest problem is deciding if I have enough time to get involved in the silliness.

On the train now, should be at work no later than 2, and boy could I use a nap.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I went and saw Dr. Malani, who gave me antibiotics, and in about a day and a half I was feeling much better. Now I feel good enough that I'm guilty for not going to the gym.  I really need to work out.

I've made good progress on the ceiling.  Started the painting, and took down the hermetically sealed plastic dust barrier, which make our living room much more pleasant.  I need a few more coats of paint and some blue touch up on the walls and we can move our furniture back to where it goes.  I can't wait.

Now we have to prioritize the next few projects.

1) Paint the stairwell
2) Carpet the stairs (dependant on #1)
3) Clear out the guest room to make it Leah's new room
4) Purchase furniture, paint and other niceties for Leah's new room (prereq: #3)
5) Patio
6) Repair lawn with compost and overseeding (stupid fertilizer/pesticide, I just wanted to get rid of the ants)

Between home projects, the fact that this month is chaos at work since we are about to go live with my big project and the work contest it is looking a little overwhelming. Why is it when we are overwhelmed we get less done, but have more to do?  Not helpful.

In fun new, little miss has a new favorite song.  The ABC's.  She will get all excited and ask for "more-more" even before we finish.  She dosn't know all her letters, infact she normally says "C-C-C" but throws in a few random letters, maybe a "B" maybe a "R." She definitely knows "Z," her favorite letter, which she screams as loud as she can.  And once the song is down we throw our hands up in the air and yell "touchdown!"

I can't wait till she goes to kindergarten and wants to know why everyone else says something as obvious as "now I know my ABC's" at the end of the song.  Those losers.

Oh, a co-worker was able to convince work that I need to go to the RailsConf at the end of the month, so I am psyched about that.  I should check with Paulo to see if he is going again this year.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Pete, Shawn and I stayed late last night to crank out the integrated ecomm stuff that has been demanded of us.  While it was extremely frustrating from a I-think-they-will-yank-it-in-6-months point of view, it was actually fun to hack away and actually produce working results. Pete pointed out that we had more consecutive coding hours in the office than we had been able to pull off in months. This managing thing really sucks your day away. Plenty of the other guys stayed later than normal to help (or at least offered to do so), plus Shawn insisted on staying until we were all done.  Made all the difference, having the team unified like that. Oh, and our California colleague was right in it with us, though three time zones away (and he had to do all his work in C++).

With all it's frustrations (and late nights) I love my job.

Since it is supposed to rain today, I had Kelly pick up some compost.  Don't worry, they loaded it for her. But with the late night I was out seeding and composting 'bout 10:30.  Kinda makes you wonder what the neighbours thought.  Oh, I did screw it up a bit. I went down stairs and grabbed a bag of grass seed to come up and over seed the spots I burned with fertilizer.  Well it was dark and I didn't notice it was fertilizer and was able to dump a few good handfuls on a couple of the already burned spots. So I proceeded, in the dark, to try and pick it back up.  I ripped up the dead grass, scrapped the dirt--barehanded--to get as much as I could.  Noticing there was still a decent amount in the healthy grass next to the dead spot, I got out the hose to wash it out and attempted to scoop it up with my hands.  This mostly resulted in what one could call a muddy mess.  I did get alot back up, I just hope it is enough to save what healthy grass.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I've been out in Oregon at RailsConf.  As you might have noticed from twitter, I've been here three days now.  The Conference has been outstanding, and the people here make up one of the coolest communities I have ever been exposed too. The problem with the first few days out here was the happening going on back home. Three things really sucked the joy out of this otherwise awesome geektopia, a client at work who thinks fire alarms are the proper way to do business, getting my credit card number stolen, and the programming contest at work.

Lets touch on these in reverse order.  The contest was optional, but I have a teammate who worked very hard and I was not about to leave him hanging.  Unfortunately I was out of town (here, in OR) when they were presenting the projects in the office.  To handle this I created a screen cast.  Which is not the quickest or easiest thing in the world to do.  I quickly got a copy of QuickTime Pro and iShowU and threw something together.  A few tries through and I was pretty happy.  Figured one more try and I'd be set.  But nothing worked that time, it was 4 AM my time, and I had a decent run.  So I uploaded it and crashed. It was just time to be done with that.

It sucks to get your CC stolen.  If the thief reads my blog: I canceled the account. And you are a mean jerk.

The fire alarm as a development methodology is really starting to wear me out.  I had been running strong with with the "my project, my baby" feeling, but as I have been reminded it isn't.  Which really removes the desire to meet the--artificial--deadlines at all cost. I still want to succeed, but it is hard when the people who are helping you don't help.  Sorta like the curly haired helper, but not cute nor do they give out hugs so happily.

I am just burnt out on the project, and need something fresh.  Or a vacation.  Or a few weeks paternity leave.

OK, a much happier post on the way, stay tuned.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I decided I'd like to access my home computer from work, specifically I wanted to be able to ssh into the machine. I used to do this by setting up a dynamic host name and just leaving my computer on all day long, but that hardly seemed like the best way to deal with it.  More specifically, I didn't really want to pay for the electricity of running that thing all day long.  So I decided to look into what I needed to do to get Wake-on-LAN to work with my Power Mac and FiOS modem.

<ol><li>First was to go back to Dyndns.com and get a hostname for my compy. I like the "homeip.net" ones, cause, it is in my home. </li><li>Configure my router to port forward ssh (tcp on port 22) </li>
<li>And wake-on-lan (udp on port 9) to my desktop.</li><li>Configure OS X to allow ssh (System Prefrences -> Sharing -> Check "Remote Login") </li>
<li>And to allow wake-on-lan (System Prefrences -> Energy Saver -> Show Details -> Check "Wake for Ethernet..."
</li>
</ol>

Now I just needed a way to wake it up. First I played with [this web page](http://www.dslreports.com/wakeup), which worked, but required me to type in my Desktop's MAC address every time.  Uncool.  Then I found a little perl script that could do it, sorta.  At that point I realized this was a job for ruby. And lo and behold I found K. Kodama [WOL Class](http://www.math.kobe-u.ac.jp/~kodama/tips-WakeOnLAN.html), which did nearly exactly what I wanted.    I took that and hacked it up so my settings were all hard coded, added a she-bang, made it executable and linked to it from somewhere in my path.  Now I can simply type "wakebold" and it will wake up my desktop at home (whom  have affectionally named "bold").

My changes were really easy:
<pre class="code">
# Configure the IP and MAC address for the computer you want here:
SETTINGS = { :mac_addr => "00:00:00:00:00:00", :host_name => "example.homeip.net"}

if $0 == __FILE__
  wol=WakeOnLan.new
  wol.wake(SETTINGS[:mac_addr], "255.255.255.255", SETTINGS[:host_name])
  wol.close
  puts "Waking up #{SETTINGS[:host_name]}"
end
</pre>
My hacked version can be found in my [svn repo](http://www.fuzzymonk.com/svn/wakeywakey).

To do all this, you can do the following:
<pre class="code">
svn co http://www.fuzzymonk.com/svn/wakeywakey
chmod +x wakeywakey/wakey.rb
ln -s wakeywakey/wakey.rb /usr/local/bin/wakebold # or elsewhere in your path
</pre>]]></content:encoded>

<title>Javascript Code Prettifier</title>
<link>http://wp.fuzzymonk.com/?p=551</link>

<description></description>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[I really liked the idea of the [Javascript Code Prettifier](http://google-code-prettify.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/README.html), and I really like my [personal color scheme](http://www.fuzzymonk.com/svn/settings/vim/vimfiles/colors/ristoink.vim), so I wanted to combine them.  I thought it was turned out pretty neat, espcially since it only took about 20 min of tinkering to get everything sorted out, so I wanted to contribute back to the author -- but he provides no simple way to do that, so I will tell you about it. You who are prolly only coming here for the pics of Leah (see previous post).

Here is my color scheme for JS Prettifier:

<pre class="sh_css">
/* Pretty printing styles. Used with prettify.js. */
/* Modifying to match RistoInk, with thanks to VibrantInk */
.str { color: #66FF00; }
.kwd { color: #AAAAAA; }
.com { color: #AA66FF; }
.typ { color: #DDE93D; }
.lit { color: #339999; }
.pun { color: #AAAAAA; }
.pln { color: #FFFFFF; }
.tag { color: #AAFFFF; }
.atn { color: #FF6600; }
.atv { color: #66FF00; }
.dec { color: #FF6600; }
pre.prettyprint { padding: 2px; border: 1px solid #888; background-color: #000000;}
</pre>

The only other change is, I wanted the tags surrounding the code to be &lt;pre class="code"&gt; instead of &lt;pre class="prettyprint"&gt;, because I just type raw html and that would be shorter and easier to remember (at least for me).

You can see those files directly:
<ul>
<li>[prettify.css](http://www.fuzzymonk.com/styles/prettify.css)</li>
<li>[prettify.js](http://www.fuzzymonk.com/js/prettify.js)</li>
</ul>

Check out some fun ruby code (and it's whitespace independence):
<pre class="code">
hash = { :water => 'wet', :fire => 'hot' }
puts hash[:fire] # Prints:  hot

hash.each_pair do |key, value| # Or:  hash.each do |key, value|
       puts "#{key} is #{value}"
end

# Prints:  water is wet
#          fire is hot

hash.delete :water # Deletes :water => 'wet'
hash.delete_if {|k,value| value=='hot'} # Deletes :fire => 'hot'
</pre>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Leah's talking has really taken off in the bast few weeks.  She is finally coming up with some phrases all on her own. I think "Ouch Leah" might be one of my favorite.  "Spicy-JUICE!!!" is another.

Which reminds me, Leah has decided she likes hot wings.  So much that she ate over half of mine. I had to debone and skin them, so I was a little slower in the eating part, but she was going to town.  After a few big bites she would cough a little and fumble around for her juice.  At least my two year old has good taste.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I've been tinkering with git, and git-svn.  Starting to figure out how to cope, and am hopeful that the real coolness of distributed systems will become apparent soon.

The real trick, was finally getting it to install with the options I had hoped for: svn integration, command completion and a custom bash prompt.

First, to install it via Mac Ports (other articles I read had either "+svn" or "+ bash_completion", but not both)
<pre class="sh_sh">
sudo port install git-core +bash_completion +svn +doc
</pre>

Set up [Arya Asemanfar's](http://unboundimagination.com/Current-Git-Branch-in-Bash-Prompt) bash prompt and add git command completion.

I added the following to .bash_login
<pre class="sh_sh">
# Command Completion
source /opt/local/etc/bash_completion.d/git

# Custom Prompt
parse_git_branch() {
  git branch 2> /dev/null | sed -e '/^[^*]/d' -e 's/* \(.*\)/(git::\1)/'
}
parse_svn_branch() {
  parse_svn_url | sed -e 's#^'"$(parse_svn_repository_root)"'##g' | awk -F / '{print "(svn::"$1 "/" $2 ")"}'
}
parse_svn_url() {
  svn info 2>/dev/null | grep -e '^URL*' | sed -e 's#^URL: *\(.*\)#\1#g '
}
parse_svn_repository_root() {
  svn info 2>/dev/null | grep -e '^Repository Root:*' | sed -e 's#^Repository Root: *\(.*\)#\1\/#g '
}
export PS1="\[\033[00m\]\u@\h:\[\033[01;34m\]\w \[\033[31m\]\$(parse_git_branch)\$(parse_svn_branch)\[\033[00m\]$\[\033[00m\] "
</pre>

Once you get to that point, I recommend heading over to [Intridea's](http://www.intridea.com/2008/6/18/going-rogue-with-git-svn-on-os-x) Getting Rogue with git-svn, it has been a great help for me.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I've been trying to get everything organized recently.  I tend to go through waves of hyper-organization to utter disregard to keeping track of stuff. Now that work is all over the place on a consistent basis I need to be consistently organized.

My problem is I am all over the place.  I use outlook and my blackberry for work stuff, and out look is running on my mac in a VM.  Personal stuff I use gmail and gcal, which is nicely integrated with my wife's calendar (which is important, b/c she normally knows when I need to be places before I do).  Personal Calendar and email stuff I integrate with the iCal through [CalDav](http://www.google.com/support/calendar/bin/answer.py?answer=99358), and Mail.app hearts IMAP.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I figured I could post the details here of what's going on with the little boy.  Good news is he is doing better now, but had a bit of a rough day.

Everything was shiny happy until 10:30 this morning when the Lactation Consultant was worried about his breathing, which was supposed to be 30 breaths per min, not 60.  Initially they were worried he had an oxygen deficiency, but the monitors he was hooked up to showed that he was ok in that area.  However, they did test his blood sugar and he was too low so the Doc said we had to supplement with formula.  Turns out that low blood sugar is  expected with breast-fed babies, but combined with the rapid breathing was reason enough to feed him the stinky stuff.

They also ordered a chest X-Ray, which turned up some fluid in his lungs.  Apparently this is fairly normal with planned C-Sections, since he didn't get a good squeezing to help remove any extra liquid.

Nursing is not going as well as we would hope, but as we found out with Leah, that is not the end of the world (and with today's events doesn't seem like a big deal at all).

Pray for Laurence's Mama, she is prolly taking it the worst of anyone. I have currently taken her phone away and she will get calling privileges back after she has a few hours of continuos sleep.

The latest word on the boy is he is off the O2 monitor and is allowed to come back to our room (which I declined so Mom could get some sleep).  After I fed him last the Doc came and measured his blood sugar and breathing and seemed happy with the improvements.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Things have been going well.  Laurence is starting to have some awake and alert time, however it tends to be between 11 PM and 3 AM.  So his mom and I are coping with that.  When he was born he was clearly too small for his skin, but finally starting to fill it in.  Still seems super tiny when his giant sister is around.

Speaking of which, she is doing well.  Had this kid around for a while and she still likes him. A bit cranky in the pants but other than that very fun to be around.  I can't wait till she gets a chance to teach her brother all the fun games she knows.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[When putting Leah down for her naps or bedtime we sing songs, we have gotten to the point where we ask her what songs she wants to sing. This is how that conversation normally goes:

Dad: OK Leah, we can sing 3 songs, what song do you want to sing first?
Leah: Itsy Spider
Dad: Itsy Bitsy Spider it is.
[singing]
Dad: OK Leah, we can sing 2 more songs, what song do you want to sing next?
Leah: Football!
Dad: How about Hush Little Baby?
Leah: No. Football!
Dad: [singing]Hush little ba---
Leah: FOOTBALL!
Dad: Um. Ba budda baaa!....

Who taught her that football was a song? Cause they can do bedtime next.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Kelly has discovered that Laurence can play a few games.  Not nearly as advanced as Leah was when I blogged about her games, but he plays them all the same.

<ul>
<li>Biggest eyes</li>
<li>Holdin' meh head ups</li>
<li>I's so mad im gonna turn red</li>
<li>Pee on dad</li>
<li>It's 3 AM and i wanna eat!</li>
</ul>

Leah had an interesting nap earlier. I went up to check on her to see if she was still asleep to find a very sheepish little girl missing a diaper. I smelled a bit of an odor, and noticed the diaper folded up on the floor.  Sure enough she took her dirty diaper off and went back to bed. I can't blame her one bit--I wouldn't want to sleep in that either.  She even got the wipes and cleaned her self up.  Sure we <i>may</i> need to run the comforter through the wash, but for a two year old I was impressed.

Backing up the MacBook is bogging down the network so much that our IP phones are choppy. It also makes the compy pretty hot.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I wanted to use sqlite3 as my production DB for a [little web app](http://github.com/csexton/cookbook/tree/master) that I am working on.  Wasn't sure exactly what was going to be needed, but turns out if you add the following to your cap recipie you are all set.  Shiny!

<pre class="code">
  task :after_update_code do 
    run "ln -s #{deploy_to}/#{shared_dir}/db/production.sqlite3 #{current_release}/db/production.sqlite3" 
  end 
</pre>

You might notice I am using bort as the starting point for cookbook.  They really have done everything I need, in the way I need. Since I am using it with Dreamhost (read: Passenger) and git I really didn't need to undo ANYTHING.]]></content:encoded>

<title>Building Visual Studio Projects with Rake</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[We are building a Rails applicaiton that has a C++ client developed under windows, and needed a nice way to script things.  Since the web side of the project was in rails it seemed natural to use rake to build the C++ stuff.  Pretty simple, but in order for the devenv to get loaded we had to load some of the envorment varables up for rake. Once that was done everyting has been easy.

My Rakefile:

ENV["VCINSTALLDIR"] = 'C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC'

ENV["PATH"] = 'C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\Common7\IDE;C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\BIN;C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\Common7\Tools;C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v3.5;C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727;C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\VCPackages;' + ENV["PATH"]
ENV["INCLUDE"] = 'C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\ATLMFC\INCLUDE;C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\INCLUDE;C:\Program Files\boost\boost_1_35_0'

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Running Instiki on Dreamhost has gotten much easier since they have added Passenger (mod_rails).

Create a new fully hosted domain on dreamhost. Something like wiki.domain.com.
<ul><li> Check the “Ruby on Rails Passenger (mod_rails)” box.</li>
<li>In the Specify your web directory enter “wiki.yourdomain.com/instiki/public”</li></ul>

This will create the wiki.domain.com folder in the user’s home directory. Login to your shell account and do the following:

<pre>
cd wiki. yourdomain.com
svn checkout svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/instiki/instiki/trunk/ instiki
cd instiki
rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=production
Open wiki. yourdomain.com in your browser and set up the wiki.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I've been working on the cookbook application for the wife and couple interesting things.

I use Dreamhost, and while they rock in alot of ways they won't let me have any long running processes.  I wanted to add full text search to my cookbook (because if you can't find the recipe you want, what good is a cookbook) and I couldn't use the likes of Sphinx or Ferret.  But if I changed my DB to MySQL (which dreamhost does provide) I can use the built in fulltext search.  It is a little hackish, and MySQL specific but it works and is plenty fast for my needs.

I had to do two things:
1) Add a FULLTEXT index to my migration
<pre>
  def self.up
    ...
    execute 'ALTER TABLE recipes ENGINE = MyISAM'
    execute 'CREATE FULLTEXT INDEX ft_idx_recipes ON recipes(title,ingredients,directions)'
  end
  def self.down
    execute 'ALTER TABLE recipes DROP INDEX ft_idx_recipes'
    execute 'ALTER TABLE recipes ENGINE = InnoDB'
    drop_table :recipes
  end
</pre>
2) In my recipes controller in the search action I have the following line
<pre>
 @recipes = Recipe.find_by_sql("SELECT * FROM recipes WHERE MATCH (title, ingredients, directions) AGAINST ('#{query.gsub(/'/, "''")}');")
</pre>
The gsub bit is to sanitize the sql. Pretty simple really, and if I ever want to replace it all I need to do is modify the controller.

I found out today that the Bort guys added OpenID support to the project. Which would normally involve some obscure svn/patch hijinks to deal with, but thanks to git I can just grab their changes (I did fork [my project](http://github.com/csexton/cookbook/tree/master) from theirs to start with).

<pre>
 git branch openid # incase I screw things up
 git checkout openid # use the new branch
 git pull git://github.com/fudgestudios/bort.git master
 # Fix any conflicts and merge back to master
</pre>

Finally, did everyone know you can put alias in the .gitconfig file?  Well, you never told me.

<pre>
 [alias]
   co = checkout
   ci = commit
   st = status
</pre>]]></content:encoded>

<title>An actual real post, now with words!</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I figure that I don't have the time to really concentrate on doing work, and I have a limited time while the kids will let me sit uninterrupted at the computer -- that I should really create some more content.

Lets do a quick run down of the happenings since we got back from the family beach trip. Laurence was baptized. Kelly returned to work after 16 weeks. Tom signed up for Twitter. I got food poisoning. We had thanksgiving. Kelly's brand new car was hit by someone trying to squeeze by. Leah has learned her colors. Started looking for a new house. Have a huge list of stuff to do before we can put our house in the market. Kelly got flattened by an uber-cold. We ate thanksgiving fish.

Hmmm, I think that sums it up.

So about a week ago I woke up with what I am now thinking was food poisoning, but really could have been a bad stomach bug.  I have just never heard of a stomach bug lasting THAT long.  Seriously it was shooting out both ends for 3 days, then it took me till yesterday to not feel like vomiting. Even still I don't ever feel hungry, and I haven't poo'd in 4 days.  Normally I'm like clock work (the kind of clocks that poo), seriously folks -- how long is too long? Now that I am over that fun, I am battling a more manageable, yet still annoying, allergies.

Kelly seems like she is finally recovering from her super cold, which completely disabled her yesterday.  I think she must have slept 20 hours.  She would get up and nurse Lars, hand him over and announce "Imf going'd bake da bed." I believe she described it as "razor wire around her brain."

<img src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/blog/image/595/IMG_8226.JPG" class="picture" />

Earlier in the year we decided we were not going to go anywhere for Thanksgiving.  Turns out that Kelly's parents also intended to have a laid back T-day, and offered to drive our way and go out.  So for Thanksgiving we went to McCormick & Schmick's.  While the company was great I was rather disappointed with the meal. Seriously my Wife can make better fish and rice in 10 min with nothing but a microwave. It didn't help that we were not feeling great. The highlight of the day was taking Leah to see the windows a Macy's. She just love running around outside -- and nothing is better than outside with Uncky Neal and Grandma.

In the 16 weeks of Kelly's maternity leave I had to commute twice. Once up to Leah's daycare, then to work. This sucked. And during this time the construction on the beltway really picked up. So that inspired me to decide that I would rather pay two mortgages than continue to live with that. We have actually been to 4 places, a couple of which would work, and one that was really nice.  My criteria is walking distance to the metro, however if we can find a place in McLean that is hella close to Kelly's office I might get trumped.  Which would be fine, since West Falls Church as good parking. One thing that I didn't really expect was to be looking at single family homes that are smaller than our townhouse.

Added bonus: seems mortgage rates are improving.  If we can actually sell our place the little experiment might just lead to less stress.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I was just helping our graphic deigner set up Rails on his shiny new mac, and was using the built in Ruby plus MacPorts for gettext and ICU. Everything was cake until ICU didn't install, which was because it wasn't looking for it in /opt/local.  So to fix this:

<pre>$ sudo gem install icu -- --with-icu-dir=/opt/local/
</pre>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Christmas for the Sexton's, like always, was full of pandemonium.

We went down to Richmond to see the my side of the clan, which had the added bonus of having Nikki and Anthony.  We actually had people in every bedroom at my parents house -- I think it has been a while since that happened.  But now that the Sexton's take up 3 rooms for sleeping it the spare space seems to disappear pretty quick.

My parents bought tickes for The Demarco's, The Wilson's and us to go see the lights at the botanical gardens.  I strapped Lars in the snugli, and we wondered in the cold looking at everything. The smores were fun but $3 for a bag with a gram cracker, marshmallow or two and a half a Hershey's bar seemed a bit steep. But it was worth it to watch Leah swing a flaming marshmellow at her mom's face.

Leah and her mom in the light maze

We had an early Christmas at my parents before we left to Grandma's for second Christmas.  We packed up the loot (recieve much more than we gave, that's for sure), and headed back up to Burke to prep for Christmas morning (a.k.a. third Christmas).  By the time we were finally up and playing with the presents from Santa man, them Tulli showed up for forth Christmas.

Christmas twice is nice, but four....is awesome.

The best part is Leah finally gets it. And not only that be was extremely well behaved. I am not sure how we did it, nor how long it is gonna last, but I will take the good behavior while I can get it.

And now, what everyone wants, pictures:

Now I will leave you with a little saying that Leah has learned from her dad. I bet this will never get old.

This wasn't too hard, but since OSX does not have ssh-copy-id by default I would have to pull up [the instructions](http://www.webficient.com/2007/11/16/mac-and-ssh-keys) every time to make sure I remembered the file names and permissions just right.

So last night I made a ruby gem to remember how to do it for me,  [ssh-keyput](http://github.com/csexton/ssh-keyput/)

Now all I's got to do to copy my public key is:

<pre>
$ ssh-keyput chris@server.com
</pre>

To install all you need is a simple gem install:

<pre>
$ gem install csexton-ssh-keyput -s http://gems.github.com
</pre>

It is nothign bu a gloafied wrapper for a few shell commands, but it is much easier to remember]]></content:encoded>

<title>Lets see how bad the housing market really is.</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[We have decided that we can't take our commute any more.  Kelly has the chance to listen to 2 kids scream for a commute that can take upwards of an hour we've decided that this is simply not good lifestyle.  And if she gets home and decides she wants some help -- she gives me a call and it might be more than an hour and a half for me to walk in the door.

Yeah, not really working for me.

So we are looking for a new place. We started looking near Dunn Lorring or one of the Falls Church Metro stops.  But I think we decided we really prefer West Fall Church/McLean.  The more I think about it, the better my wife's commute the happier I am gonna be. Weird how that works.

We did find one house that was, well, ideal.  Unfortunately by the time we got to go see it it was already under contract. It was a bit on the pricy side (all the 'ideal' ones are), but totally worth it.

While we considered buying before selling, I think we've deiced don't like that idea, so have stepped up the 'getting the house ready' tasks.  The sad thing is now that we are replacing all the light fixtures, painting, building circuit breaker doors, installing range hoods -- well, it really makes the current place nice.  Man, all these little things add up.  Hopefully it will help when people come look at it.

I know people do it all the time, but I don't know what we are going to do once it is listed and we get calls that someone wants to come see our place and we are waist deep in dirty diapers and kids toys.  You can't keep the house clean with a toddler AND a baby.

So, anyone want to buy a townhouse in Burke?  It's got new light fixtures!]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I lost my keys. I really couldn't find them.  I looked everywhere they could be, everywhere that is within reach of a two and a half year old. The really crappy part is they have my hard token on them.  I did not want to call IT and have to get a new one, with "director level" approval. Ugh.

Retraced my steps.  Last time I saw them was when I had Kelly read me the secret numbers so I could send an email.  On a side note: sending email takes way too much effort. I remember that she did this very clearly because she read the numbers upside down to start with. She claims that she then physically handed me the keys. But I firmly but disagreed.  Oh, another side note: don't disagree with your wife when it just doesn't matter.

After going through the desk and my bag, we both agreed that little miss must have taken them.  I seem to remember the 'fixing' of my tower with keys. And I think that occurred after the upside down number incident.

We pulled up the couch. Went through the fridge and cabinets. Litter box. Trash cans. Toy boxes.

Nothing.

I was in the kitchen going through the shoe pile when kelly announce that she 'though she just heard them.'  Understanding that left to their own devices my keys do not make any sound I could only figure she was mocking me in some way.  But nope, she had ninja like hearing and heard a little jingle when standing up from our desk chair.

Well that desk chair is a fancy feux Areon from Office Max, and happens to have an elabrate truss system for the lumbar support, that, from the point of view of a two year old, makes a hand place to store some fixin' keys.

Had Kelly not heard them I don't think I would have found them until the next time I disasemmebled my office chair. And I don't know about you, but I don't disassemble my office chair very often at all. Maybe I should start, who knows what I might find.]]></content:encoded>

<title>Potty training is war</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Since last time I posted we have passed a few milestones here in the Sexton household.  Laurence has gone from scooting to crawling and standing.  Recently he has been starting to cruse around furniture while holding on.  Started to get the controlled fall thing down. Baby break falling is pretty simple, if you are starting to topple -- sit! His diaper helps pad the landing.  Works out pretty well most of the time.

The other huge milestone was Leah's. We officially have a potty trained toddler.  We followed the book [Potty Training Boot Camp](http://www.amazon.com/POTTY-BOOT-CAMP-Training-Toddlers/dp/1601455194) which I think was a solid success. But it was not easy. There was plenty of crying,  throwing tantrums, running naked and protesting -- and that was just me.  Leah had similar behavior. Now that the battle is over, we are better for it. Leah still stresses about it, but is getting better. We have been able to venture on longer car rides and walks with nary an accident.

We have persisted the bribe for peeing or pooping in the potty -- and I am willing to continue it until her twenties if I have to -- candy. that goes for anyone at Ft. Truxion: if you pee in the potty, all you have to do is 1) put your underwear back on and 2) do that "I did it dance" and you will receive candy.

Sweet deal.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[It has been a long time, I think twitter is bad for my blogging schedule.

Well, lets recap the last lots of weeks.

Leah went to Texas with her grandma, and returned with a strong command of family relationships. We can ask her questions like who is your Mommy's Grandma or who is Grandma's Mommy and she will nail them.  I don't think I had that good of an understanding until I was 12.  She has explained in great detail about how she went on the black airplane in the sky with &lt;whisper&gt; grandma &lt;/whisper&gt;.

Shortly after that, or was it before that, Kelly went to Boston for work.  I think she was gone 3 days, but it felt like weeks.  I had to reconfigure the morning routine so that I could handle it.  I cannot deal with the complexities of getting the kids dressed, fed and in the car first thing in the morning.

Before things settled down from the first couple trips I ran of to RailsConf in Vegas.  The fun part of this trip was convincing Kelly to come join me.  Vegas is a much different place when you decidedly pace your self and try to relax.  I am really glad that my coworker, Scott, and his wife were able to hang out with us for the weekend.  That town is just too weird to be with out friends. It was a good trip, from the sad story of Monorail Pidgin to the joy that was [Bouchon](http://www.bouchonbistro.com/).

We've only been back a week now but I am going to be scooting off to San Francisco for WWDC in a week -- poor wife.  All this travel has Leah a little out of wack and I saved my longest trip for last.  You know, to rub it in.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Henry has a serious problem. No, not the stink butt. Well, related to the sink butt. He has taken to 'presenting.' I will be sitting very nicely on the floor reading books with my little girl and this cat will come settle down inches away (he is determined to get as close as felinely possible to my face), and raise his tail straight into the air -- haunches slightly elevated. If you brush him even slightly the hind quarters shoot into the air.

This is gross.

Especially if he is currently in full stink-butt mode. So, I have been looking for a way to fix this.  I have tried simply turning him around, which seemed to be working ok, but he will often turn back around. And always starts by facing butt-wards.

I have tried scolding the cat while I turn him around, no workie.  So I need to explore possible strategies for preventing this behavior. Here is what I have come up with:

<ul><li> Keep a ball point pen around to insert into the nearest orafice when he presents. I cannot imagine the behavior will persist if there is any probing done on a regualr basis. I have ruled this option out, as I would never be able to look Henry in the eye again.</li></ul>

OK, so that is the only option I have come up with so far.  If anyone has an suggestions please let me know.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[It helps that it was a long weekend, but it also had quality content.

Saturday we went to Sweet Life Cafe and had an (almost) private show, met up with Beej to help on the kitchen (although we mostly just played at the park).

 We wrapped up the day with Sean and Nina. We let them kids stay up a little later than normal so they could hang out. Discussion seemed to be centered around child development strategy and zombie board games.

Sunday we met one of Kelly's friends and her family for Lunch at P.F. Chang's over at Fairfax Square. Being a very hot and sunny day we decided to head over to the fountains. Luckily Kelly had preplanned and packed swimsuits for the kids. The boys were not so sure about this, but Leah was. She ran around with kids twice her size and had a blast. The impressive thing was the black eye she got. It was not impressive that she got a black eye, but rather she took the elbow to the face and didn't miss a beat. That is a girl serious about her fun. Laurence on the other hand decided he had quite enough once he caught a fountain to the face.

For dinner we headed out to National Harbor and met with the Tres Tulli for a tasty dinner at Rosa Mexacana. Which we followed up with Neal and Leah climbing on "The Awakening" and Gelato. The highlight of the evening had to be when Neal's dinner fought back and won. Now that's spicy!

Today was a lazy day at home. I got up with Lars around 7:30, played for a bit and then he and I went down for morning naps around 9. Slept until noon. It was legendary.

The rest of the day was just spent wrangling kids, making an experimental dinner, watching a movie with the wife during a simulnap.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<i>Guest post by Kelly</i>

This week was a hard week. About this time last Sunday my brother informed me that while I was at church my parents had called to say that my Grandma Lawson had passed away.  We’d been expecting it for a week so it wasn’t a shock, but it was still quite sad.  She was my last grandparent.  My mom had to play family peacemaker on top of grieving for her mother.  Grandma never met Laurence.  I certainly didn’t call or write often enough.  And I had to explain death to Leah somehow since she had just seen my Grandma the month before and talked about her regularly.

The viewing was Tuesday night and I saw lots of family I hadn’t seen in a while.  Services were first thing Wednesday morning and they were nicely done.  And the kids brought some joy to an otherwise sad occasion.

None of this was the hard part of the week.  Well, maybe telling Leah about death was hard.

The hard part of the week was the constant trials and tribulations thrown in our path from a logistical point of view.  Here are just a few of the challenges we faced:
<ul>
<li>Chris was in SFO, leaving me to single parent it while I planned and packed – I did tell him to go ahead and go, but still, it’s harder when he’s not around</li>
<li>The garage at DCA is under construction and impossible to navigate</li>
<li>The check-in machines for American don’t deal well with split parties</li>
<li>Renting two cars from someone who didn’t realize we wanted two separate cars</li>
<li>Reconciling TomTom’s instructions and my dad’s pre-planned routes</li>
<li>Finding places to eat that are both kid friendly and dad friendly</li>
<li>Sharing a hotel room with two kids who have different nap schedules</li>
<li>The bazillion outlets and drawers in said hotel room that Lars was magnetically drawn to</li>
<li>The tornados</li>
<li>The 3:00 a.m. fire alarm – which the fire department didn’t show up to turn off until 3:30</li>
<li>Locking myself out of the room during the fire alarm while Lars was still inside and I didn’t yet know it was a false alarm</li>
<li>And of course the “moving the Russian Army” sized task of flying with two small kids half way across the country</li>
</ul>

And there was more to be sure, but I’m already placing a mental block on a lot of this past week.  My bother and parents suffered through all of this with us Sextons and each had their own things to add to the list.  None of us, except my mom, handled every situation with grace, but we were all still speaking to each other when we got home, and I think we’ll even be willing to hang out together again sometime soon.

So, hopefully this next week will be kinder to us all.  We could sure use the break.

God bless you Grandma, we miss you lots, and you were worth every little bit of trouble that we went through!]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I wrote [this](http://www.uswushuacademy.com/academy/events/Adventure_KingsDomion01.html), although I don't remember writing it. I do remember going there -- and I am clearly the "me" in this post.

<i>There was a time when we did not know how large groupes of people would react to our students in public. So we took a group to Kinds dominion to preform a few expermints. We found that the main reaction to doing the splits between the hand rails -- while waiting in line for the Hurler -- is only a few awkward stares. It turns out that most people don't even notice that we are exchangin a flurry of mock attacks while wondering between rides. Hardly anyone noticed that we were bowing to the camera on that first big drop.

The high points of our trip included such things as having to hold Joanna in the Rebel Yell (or she would have flown out!) and Sending Meline, Suzie and Me on the Extreme Flyer. I leaned two things from that ride -- Suzie is not scared of anything and Mel is freakishly strong.

Overall our trip to Kings Dominion was a success, While I am not sure that the Public in general is ready for wushu students, they did not reject us out right. However Keye did seem to baffel them with his softball-basket-toss skills.</i>

Good times.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[If you follow me on twitter (and if you read this I would guess you do) you probably have notice that Leah has a [twitter account](http://twitter.com/miss_pants).  Well, if you see a post there in quotes it is something she actually said. While twitter does a great job as for displaying one liners it is awkward to post the more nuanced converstaions with her there. And I personally think some of those are the most in need of keeping around.

For example, here is what was said a mere 2 min ago:

<b>Chris</b> (to the cat): Yeah, she is going commando.
<b>Leah</b>: MANDO!

OK, maybe not the best example, but I still think it is really funny. Of course that could be a lack of sleep making me all punchy.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Kelly took Leah to the grocery store to get us dinner and I jumped at the oppertunity. It was time to give that boy a haircut. I knew the risk I was taking, but I wasn't going to chance people starting to think his pretty curls meant he was a girl. So I busted out the clippers.

Handsome and cute. Dad wins!

When Kelly got home she said he looked like his dad. Then started crying.

The good news is I am unharmed, however she knows where I sleep.  I may wake up bald.]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>Leah kept asking for candy, I assume it is because she found the bowl of M&amp;Ms I stuck on the top shelf of the desk. But I didn't cave right away.</div><div>
</div>I told Leah that she could have two, count 'em, two pieces of candy if she was good for her bath. She asked if they could be green candies, and I agreed.<div>
</div><div>We then went up for baths, and she did great. Even during the de-tangling of her hair. Her mom tagged me out about 1/2 way though. When they were  done they cam back downstairs and she asked if she could watch a movie. I said no, but we could play a game. She picked out candy land and Kelly reminded her that she also got to have candy. So I went and grabbed both the green M&amp;Ms and set them next to the candy land board. </div><div>
</div><div>She smiled and said "thank you." Then she handed one to me and said "we can share, this one is for you."</div><div>
</div><div>At this point I died. Yep. I must be a zombie now.</div><div>
</div><div>Seriously. How can you get a 3 year old to share HALF of her candy? Especially when all her candy consisted of a whopping 2 M&amp;Ms.</div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>

Story time, shortly after candy land. Did I mention I won this time? It was a first.</div>]]></content:encoded>

Lars has been playing nod and shake.  If you nod he will nod in return, and if you shake your head he will to. The shaking gets quite vigorous, and can last for up to a minute.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[We had family movie night again tonight. It was our second. This time we watched Madagascar 2, which had plenty of inappropriate content that was very appropriately hidden from preschooler.  Plus it made Neal and I laugh a number of times.

After the movie was over, Neal played us a song he ad been working on on the guitar. Leah danced ballet. They were both surprisingly good. I taught Leah how to do a scale and a pirouette and she was able to reproduce on demand. I think we need to take her for dance, and I need to keep telling myself that ballet is like pretty wushu in a tutu.

The real memorable moment of the night was when I went up to tuck her in. First she pointed out that I had whiskers that I needed to shave and added that she would kiss me anyway. At this point I was willing to buy her a pony. Second she pointed out that her little stuffed cat was very tiny. I told her she was tiny, to which she agreed. Then she added "but you are big, so I will give you a big hug," and threw both arms around my neck. "And a big kiss," where she grabbed my head with both hands and crammed her kiss into my cheek with all the force her tiny arms could muster.

She is surprisingly strong.]]></content:encoded>

<title>Things that go chirp in the night</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[We were awoken last night around 4 A.M. by a couple of cats who seemed to be going berserk. The were maow'ing and scampering about. I heard something bumping into the celing fan, and assumed it was a bug. You could barely see the shadow of something go zipping across the ceiling.  I heard a faint chirping sound, and remember telling Kelly that I thought it was a big insect.

I was wrong.

I had gotten up to go get a towel[*](#towel) to catch what ever critter it was and I hear Kelly shouting and came running into the bathroom.

It was a bat.

And my wife was freaking out. That made me even more spooked. I stood barricaded in the bathroom trying to figure out what I was going to do about the little guy. The best I could think of was trap him in something. So I decided I would go for a hamper. I slowly cracked the door and slipped out. As I was closing the door I heard kelly say "be careful, he could have diseases.

At first I just saw the cats looking up rotating their heads as they tracked the critter. The light was still off, so I had to go pull the string on the fan.  Which was a little freaky with a bat circling my head in the dark. Once I got it on I went downstairs to grab a hamper.  I returned with my new bat capturing device and stood in the corner observing his flight pattern. Luckily he circled in a very predictable route and I was able to swoop the hamper over him and catch him on the floor. Unfortunately the hamper made a very poor cage for such a little mammal, and he was able to easily climb out. And promptly flew up and hid on the back of the closet door.

I actually felt bad for him when I had him trapped under the hamper, he mad the most pathetic little chirps.

Now that he was on the back of the closet door I had to figure out a way to NOT loose him in the closet. So I wound up hanging a towel between him and my clothes and proceeded to try an convince him to fly up into a bag I was holding over the top of the door. He didn't like that idea at all, and opted to fly around the back and resume his previous route. At this point I thought it only prudent to close my closet door and return to my corner to watch and think.

First I discarded the hamper with it's bat-sized holes and opted for a rubbermaid tub with no holes. OK, first problem solved. Now I was back to figuing out how to get him out of the house. Then it dawned on me, open the window. I even opened the top half of the window in the hopes he would simply fly right out.

Roy (as I have started calling my furry flying friend) didn't think this was a good idea at all. However Henry did. He got all excited and made a bee-line for the very high very open window. I actually grabbed his tail as he was perched on the top of the slide down window and yanked him back in.

The only thing that would be worse than a bat in your room at o'dark'thirty would be looking for a black cat in the dark after he had fallen 2 stories to freedom.

I took the obvious course of action and grabbed the cat, ran over to the bathroom, opened the door and shoved him in. Of course to Kelly this appeared as if the door suddenly swung open and a small black animal was thrust at her. She did not have a look of calmness about her.

Now I it was just me and Roy and I had devised a plan I knew would work. I would take my old trust tub, tubby, and scoop Roy towards the window to the sweet night sky.

This was not as simple as I thought it would be, and resulted in spiking the little guy against the wall on  my first attempt. Luckily he landed happily in the soft cat bed to gather his witts before resuming his aforementioned flight pattern. The second time I gently lofted him into the window's glass. But on the third time we had a charming success. And sent him right out the window. At least I assumed that is what I did, I know I had him in the tub as I thrust it at the open window and was unable to find him afterwards. So I am guessing he is a really good hider or actually escaped.

If anyone talks to Kelly make sure to go with the latter.

With that done, it was about 5 AM, and I then had to make the rounds to make sure there were no more bats, or racoons (don't ask) in the house. I also wanted to make sure the kids were not vampires yet.

<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[EXCELLENT recap of the story. I was right on the edge of my seat. 



I&#39;d be with your Kelly on this one-- I&#39;d be FREAKING out. Interestingly enough, I discovered a bat in our sanctuary a few Sundays ago, just prior to the start of services. I had to work very hard NOT to freak out, and quietly walk away from him to find someone much braver than I, to capture him and get him out. 



Any guesses on how Roy snuck in to your house?

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Seems like all the little girls Leah's age want to be princesses. Leah has decided she like ballerinas better, and considering how this is a more noble cause (pun intended) -- ballet requires hard work, determination and flexibility (all things required for wushu, btw), I am encouraging it.

So in my recent trip to San Diego I bought her ballerina paper dolls. At a great [little shop](http://www.hillsideartisans.com/).  She loves them, so much that I played too. Yeah, I said it.

Jorge, tell Karen she needs to open a shop in Northern Virginia. She would make a KILLING.

Hillside Artisans was teh awesome, I don't think there was a single thing in the store that my wife would not like. And lets face it, when buying stuff for the kids the goal is to make the wife happy.]]></content:encoded>

<title>The Mayflower Voyage</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[It has been stressful, exhausting and all around crazy, but it seems like the hard parts are over (knock-knock). We have the inspection and appraisal on Ft. Truxion have worked out in our favor, and our offer on Mayflower was just accepted.

<img src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/mayflower/image/595/IMG_2141.JPG" class="photo" />

And the kitchen that my wife has told me she "will live, die and sleep in":

<img src="http://photos.fuzzymonk.com/mayflower/image/595/IMG_2136.JPG" class="photo" />

Apparently the cover letter Kelly composed was instrumental in swaying the owners in to accepting our offer over the competition, pasted here for posterity:

<blockquote>
Dear Mr. and Mrs. ****,
I wanted to take a moment to tell you first what a lovely home you have created and second how much my family is looking forward to the possibility of it being our new home.

When my husband and I first walked into your house I could immediately see myself living there – the main floor, and kitchen in particular just felt like the perfect home for us.  We have two toddlers – Leah who is 3 years old and Laurence who is 14 months – and I love to cook and entertain. Therefore, I spend a lot of time in the kitchen between keeping up with the kids’ growing appetites and cooking for friends and family when they stop by.  In our current house that removes me from everyone and the way you have opened up that whole floor is exactly what I am looking for to be able to take care of my family and still be able to spend time with them.

As at home as I felt in the kitchen, the kids were equally enchanted with the back yard.  They were smiling and giggling as they ran all around “the park”.  We are moving because we currently spend far too much time with the kids strapped into car seats during our commute up to McLean each day, and being able to get them home quickly and to such a wonderful place to play will make for much more enriching experiences and pleasurable memories.

Again, I must say what a lovely home you have created – we feel as if we can move in and wouldn’t need to change a thing for it to be our home too, not just our new house.  Interestingly, we bought our current house from The **** – we’d be thrilled to keep up that trend.

I wish you the best of luck in your move to ****.

Sincerely,

Kelly M Sexton

<content:encoded><![CDATA[I think letting this much time pass after beach week before writing the blog was a bad thing. Now that it has been a while it feels like it was a good vacation. It wasn't. Everyone got sick, it was fairly cold, and I never ate an actual burger form dune burger.

Well, about halfway through the week I started taking score. This pretty much sums up the week.

Beach week score

1 - 102¬∞ fever
1 - Vomit covered couch
1 - Diaper rash so bad it bled
1 - Not quite severed finger
5 - Peoples less than healthy
2 - Trips to the doctor
1 - Rescued frog from the pool
2 - Not quite so rescued crabs from pool
0 - Nights of solid sleep
5 - Trips to dune burger
3 - Trips to Kitty Hawk
1 - Never ending smoke alarm
1 - Foot splinter the size of a tooth pick
0 - Drownings
3 - Lbs of bacon
3 - Sub par offers on our house
1 - Termite damaged bath room (@ Belgrave)
25 - Muchkins
1 - Gate injury
1 - Fence Injury
1 - Poo stain on the carpet
1 - Case of vertigo
1 - Fly up the nose
1 - Cube of beef in the ear
N - High centered senors on baby gates
1 - Cat unresponsive to antibiotics
0 - Exploding oil pans on I-295

Clearly there is plenty to be grateful on that list, but plenty that made for a less than ideal vacation.

Still, it is nice to have a photogenic set o' kids:

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Today was the Halloween Parade at Leah's preschool. As per her request, she was a bird. She was also the ONLY child there (that I noticed, but I was looking) who was wearing a homemade costume. I know parents in DC tend to be busy professional types, but I figured they'd put in a little effort.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[We got quite the snow storm here. I am not sure what the official snowfall is, but we had spots in our yard that were 2' deep. We spent about 45 minutes getting ready (and they were very sad minutes, near constant crying), but once we got them out in the snow it was much happier.

Made a snow house with snow chairs, including a daddy sized one that mommy squished into a snow shea's lounge. I also discovered that Leah loves to get people to make snowballs for her, but as soon as you do you get hit by said snowball.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[Just picked up Leah and Lars and I was headed home. I popped in a CD with their music and the following conversation ensued:

<b>Leah</b>: Is this Imagination Movers?
<b>Me</b>: Yes it is.
<b>Leah</b>: I like Imaganation Movers, can we listen to it loud?
<i>*turns up radio*</i>
<b>Me</b>: ARE YOU ROCKING OUT?"
<b>Leah</b>: WHAT YOU SAY? WHAT?
<i>*turns down radio*</i>
<b>Me</b>: When you want to ask someone what they said you should say "Can you please tell me what you said?"
<b>Leah</b>: I SAID WHAT!
<b>Me</b>: No, when you ask someone that you should say "Can you tell me what you said, please?"
<b>Leah</b>: I SAID WHAT!
<b>Me</b>: YOU need to say "Can you tell me what you said, please?"
<b>Leah</b>: I SAID WHAT!
