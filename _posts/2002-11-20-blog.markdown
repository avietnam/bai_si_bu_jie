Stupid Shins.  Man they are really getting painful again. I don�t think they are as bad as they used to be, but it don�t feel too happy.  I am pushing some of that jump training stuff I used to do for conditioning.  I did a bunch of front tucks in gymnastics last night.  Then Kyle and I got into a front tuck over stuff contest.  Which he schooled me on.  Plus that was really hurting my shins.  Still didn�t tack on the back tuck after the round off back handspring.  I know I could do it, but I must get more consistent at the back handspring  <br /><br />I wanted to go to both wushu classes last night, but wound up missing the first one because I lost track of time here at work and didn�t get out soon enough to get there.  But I went to the advanced sword class � I am feeling better about my sword form now, but I can really feel the parts I suck at.  Getting to the point that I need to get video of me doing the form to see what I can fix.  <br /><br />Over all it was a pretty productive night.  No major gains, and I need to keep those coming if I am gonna get ready for my audition with cirque.  <br /><br />Important goals before cirque:<br />-Get round off back handspring back tuck<br />-Get Multi back handsprings<br />-Get butterfly - butterfly twist<br />-Get Butterfly twist with staff<br />-Get Butterfly twist split<br />-Get Tornado split<br />-Clean up my forms, learn to explode better.<br /><br />I feel the explosion stuff happening in a few places, I need to copy that and run with it.  The more I learn to relax the better it is getting.  This is why I think sword is so helpful for my wushu right now.  <br /><br />Bryan Tangren seem to be interested in taking some Capoeira classes.  That would be fun.  Good for the dance part of the Audition.<br /><br />In conclusion:  Watch good people more, see how they do it. And do that.
