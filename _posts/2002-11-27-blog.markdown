Went to gymnastics and wushu yesterday dispite not fully healing from the pulled hamstrings.  I don�t feel to bad today.  My quads are a little sore from the frog jumps we did in wushu, but over all I feel pretty good.  Shins are same painful shins.  Aiya.<br /><br />Well I found out from My Gymnastics Coach Carlos that the owner of Capital wants to get rid of the floor sooner than I thought.  So we have rallied the troops and are gonna try to buy it quickly if we are gonna be able to pull it off at all.  I found out form Emily last night that Sarah�s Dad was very interested in it.  So once I was able to track down his email (sarah was grumpy when we was doing homework, sheesh)  I sent him the details.  You know, $2200, needs to be gone by this weekend.  <br /><br />Well he called me back this morning, and he is getting Mr. Ma on our side.  Hopefully they will have a better chance of convincing Lu Xiao Ling to go for it � we are all offering to jump in and help pay for it.  But it is still two grand.  I found out that the last carpet that they had, Mr. Ma and a buddy of his (Mr. Gee) just bought it out right when they made their last move.  Damn.  They couldn�t find any other people to help out with the cost.  <br /><br />I hope I won�t have this kinda issues when I have my own school.  I plan on buying a gymnastics floor to start off with.  Or at least a cheerleading roll out floor.  And move up to a suspended foam block one quickly.  Aside form mirrors, I can�t think of any other major costs I would have to front then.  Hmmm, I will have to hit up the plans for my school with this stuff.  <br /><br />Kelly took today off and is doing laundry and cleaning up the house to get ready for us to leave for the rest of the week � for thanksgiving in Richmond.  Hopefully I won�t be needed to be around for helping with this floor situation.  But I am all sorts of ready to go see family.  Hopefully my parents will behave and get their fill of us for a while.  I will be great to hang out with Aimee and my sisters for once.  And JACOB!  I am sure he is all big and whatnot.  I gotta go teach him who I am�that cool uncle! <br />
