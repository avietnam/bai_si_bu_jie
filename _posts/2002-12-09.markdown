Well this weekend was a blast.  I left work around 2:30 or 3 on Friday to go meet dean at the airport.  He is much taller than I expected him to be.  Really didn�t look like how I thought.  Not that it is a bad thing, or that I even care, I just figured I would have a better mental image of the guy from the videos/pictures I had seen.  His wushu was surprisingly good.  Some stuff was a little awkward but his b-twists and front snap kicks were crazy clean.  Plus he had this old school flavor.  It was cool having him come hang out.  I do feel like I kinda ignored him a little too much, like during my b-day party I don�t� think I talked to him that much, I was playing games and laughing it up with some of the old USWA peeps.  <br /><br />Training was good.  Friday, I took both the intermediate and advanced class.  I also saw the Ba Gua class.  I really want to take that.  Only problem is it happens on Friday at 5.  I am gonna try to go, however.  Ba Gua is so intriguing to me, plus I need to start learning some of the �slower� wushu styles.  And I don�t think I am ready for taiji slow just yet. Chen is hella interesting though.  Anyway, by the time we finished Saturday class my shins were killing me.   I am taking tonight off to lift and heal.<br /><br />They were building the rest of the floor on Saturday after class, I wish I could have helped more, but people were in town and I had to go make showings at different places.  Gerald, Sean, Dean and I did help haul in lumbar.  So we are not THAT bad.   You should have seen Emily when she noticed sean was at O-Mei.  Heh.<br /><br />Kelly Gerald and I went over to Todd�s place for his and Marilee�s little Christmas Open House thingy, it was pretty cool.  So much food, she really like entertaining I think.  Found out Brian Key Eloped.  Nice to see Todd, too bad Beej wasn�t there. <br /><br />Sunday was nice.  We all took dean to the airport and had lunch with him.  We were sitting at the little mini-bar thing at the TGI Fridays in national, and had an extra guy at out table.  We made friends with him and Sean dealt him into the card game �thief� we have been playing, that was cool.  Fun game too.<br /><br />After Chinese school on Sunday I came home and Kelly was asleep and Sean was still playing video games.  I really like having him over, but it was time for some alone time with my wife.  So we told him we were gonna go out to dinner.  I am pretty sure he knew we had not intention of leaving, but wanted to ask him to leave nicely.  He even apologized for over-staying.  We like Sean a lot, even when he overstays.  Crazy guy.<br /><br />Chinese class was fun too; there were 4 of us.  The other three were teenagers, Pan Hong Gon, Shu Ling jing, Fei Wen Hao and me.  They all got yelled at for not practicing, but she said I was exempt from the yelling because I am old and try hard.  But they are young and would learn fast if they would try just a little bit more.  Heh.  I guess the difference is I think it would be really cool if I could speak Chinese and they are being forced to go class.  Go figure. <br /><br />Realization: My Chinese is not nearly good enough to go to China with, I have no oral comprehension.  Dean is tall. Train harder, longer and more often � gotta get ready for China.<br />
