Still suffering from side effects from the surgery.  I called the doctor�s office yesterday and told htem aobu the pain in the upper right side of my mouth.  They made me come it so that Dr. LaBriola could take a look.  Turns out it is muscle cramping from my jaw.  So painful.  So he gave me some new meds.  �Lodine XL�  Man, I hate taking more drugs � but this stuff worked great for about 8 hours, then the pain was back and in force.  It is supposed to last a good 12 hours, but it starts to wear off after about 6, hurts like hell after about 10.  I took my first dose yesterday as soon as I got it at about 4:30 or so.  I was golden for a while.  Even went to sword class.  Ate dinner at the Bell no problem.  As I was going to bed I was hurting again � just not very bad.  I was able to go to sleep.  Then, at 3 AM I woke up with serious pain.  Felt like someone had hit me in the face with an Ax.  From the bottom of my jaw to my ear and temple it was a overwhelming pain.  I lasted about 30 min trying the heating pad and moaning a lot before I took some more Lidine XL, in about an hour it kicked in and I was sleeping like a baby.  Well.  Now it is 11 AM, 8 hours after I took it. And the pain is back.  I was hoping that it was a drug that would build up in your system, and it would be more potent after a few doses, but it doesn�t seem that way.  The suckiest thing is I called the dentist at 10:30 or so and it rang a dozen times and I went directly to hold.  So I hung up.  Called back at 11 and got the after hours service � they are out to lunch until 1:30.  I should be in some mighty good pain by then.  Yay!<br /><br />Some good news is I got the DVD done.  Burned 3 copies, and designed and printed out a few covers for the case.  Looks pretty good.  I went to Best buy and Staples looking for DVD cases, but no luck.  So I ordered a pack from Shop4Tech.com � until they get here I am just gonna take some of my DVD�s out of their case and use those.  <br /><br />We are going to dinner with Greg, Sean, Keye, Paulo and Mel so I would like to give them their copies tonight if I can.  I need to print out a few more covers before I leave on the nice color laser printer � so far I only have 2.  <br /><br />I am gonna try to do some coding, it is very hard to do when you hurt.  Especially an all-consuming pain like this one.  I knew I should have jumped out the window on Friday like I wanted to.<br />
