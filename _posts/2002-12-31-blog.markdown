Well I talked to Paulo last night and got a few emails form Greg � we are doing new years over at Greg and Sean�s place.  I feel rather bad that I just dissed Kelly�s friend Jen with out even a second thought.  BUT we get to hang out with a bunch of cool people that we all feel comfortable with and would like to see more often.  Looks like the list of attendees is: Greg, Sean, Paulo, Melanie, Suzie, Kelly and Me.  Maybe Keye. Not a very big gathering but great for playing some games and all that.<br /><br />Didn�t go to wushu last night even though I can�t go tonight or tomorrow.  I think it was a good choice.  I got to hang out with Kelly and it was really nice.  She didn�t let us get sucked into to sitting around staring at the TV or nothing.  We had a test run of Hoopla and then played a game of Go.  (I was supposed to play Cameron last night, but had to go to bed).  Kelly also was able to sneak in a hour long nap while I did some work on the computer.  <br /><br />I had a terrible time getting to sleep last night.  Just tossing and turning.  I really should have turned on the light and read some of FOTR, but I thought I was tired enough to drift off into sleepy land. <br /><br />New favorite word: disport: to amuse one self in a light frolicsome manner.  I used it a few times yesterday for some reason and decided that I like it. Kelly wanted to know how I knew words she didn�t.  I think that is 1 word she didn�t know to a large pile that I don�t know.  Don�t get me started on her math skills.  At least I have my powers of two.  No. Wait.  I can�t do those anymore past 1024.  How sad.<br /><br />Time to work.  Kim is making me leave 2 hour early and charge it to vacation.  Arg.<br />
