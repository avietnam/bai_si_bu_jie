It was a long weekend all with out a wife.  Hung out with Sean and Josh a lot, and that was fun.  Would have liked to see a few other people also (Dmitry showed up on Friday night), but I don�t have any complaints.  At least with these fellas I can play lots of abstract strategy games and every one is happy.<br /><br />Kelly�s dental work reportedly was a success.  No complaints from her other than sore gums.  She has to be careful because this is a temporary thing and is not as strong as the real tooth or the permanent bridge.   I am just happy she is coming home tonight.  I didn�t do any laundry the entire time she was gone.  And I am out of underwear now.   Not that I couldn�t do it, but it was more a protest thing.  Of course this morning I wanted to clean the house for her return, but I was already late for work when I finally pried my self out of bed.  <br /><br />That�ll teach me to stay up till 3 am reading Tolken.<br /><br />People are starting to ask me to buy them things in china.  I am slightly annoyed at this.  I don�t mind getting some stuff for certain people.  But the larger the gifts they ask for the more annoyed I am. Not large like price, but rather size.  Josh mentioned something about how I had to get at least 3 taiji swords: one for me, Gerald and him.  I don�t mind getting him one, and it�s not like I hardly know him or any thing, but I feel like he is demanding.  I think that is the issue.  It�s not so much what they ask, but how.  I am not trying to say it is Josh, but that was just a recent case and it is fresh in my mind.  There have been a number of people that I work hard for and put a lot of my time effort and money into helping them out only to discover that they are happy with my work but don�t want to bother doing the same back.<br /><br />Now I am supposed to write something trite about how in the end it will work out, and God will know and Bla bla blabity-ble.  But c�mon.  I will however decided that I don�t give a poo about getting stuff in return and I will do it because I want to.  So take that.  <br /><br />Take?  What should I take�..to china?<br />Pepto-Bismol, Aspirin, Tylenol PM and Cold/Flu.<br />2 pairs of jeans.<br />Sweatpants and wushu pants.<br />Few dark t-shirts.<br />Winter coat hat and gloves.<br />Empty weapons case<br />In Flight entertainment (Cryptonomicron, Chinese study marterials, Science of sports training)<br />Lots of extra contacts and toiletries <br />More�.<br />
