I did it for real.  It felt so good.  Finally hit that trick.  <a href=http://fuzzymonk.homeip.net:8080/video/chris_roundoffbackback.mpg>Check</a> it out if you want.<br /><br />Next is a layout, then a few back handsprings before the flip.  <br /><br />Of course I needed a spot the first few times to get my nerve up, but once that was settled I did it.  I drug Kelly to the gym to show off and impress my woman, but that didn�t work so well.  Before Carlos had the time to come spot me I was going Round-off back-handsprings, to which Kelly responded: �isn�t there supposed to be more?  Like a 3rd thing?�  <br /><br />It�s my own fault; she would be impressed if I stopped taking her to Jackie Chan movies.<br /><br />I ordered my evacuation insurance today.  In case of medical disaster they will fly me back to the US.  It is also other medical insurance for while I am in china � I pretty smart thing to do, IMO.  Set me back $88, but if we had to pay to get my out of china in an emergency it can run over $20K.  Wushu requires medical safety nets, me thinks.<br /><br />I think I got everything in order for my trip.  Qiu Dong wants me to send him a list of stuff I wanna buy, so he can forward it to his friends to help me gather it up.   So here is a quick brain storm:<br /><ul><li>Bunch of Straight Swords, preferably nice guiding ones.  I need at least one for Josh, Gerald, Carlos and Matt. </li><li>One nice Taiji sword</li><li>One snappy wushu straight sword</li><li>A Pudao</li><li>A Chain Whip</li><li>A Spear big enough for me (or the parts for one)</li><li>Parts for a 3-Section staff</li><li>small bundle of staffs</li><li>Chop for Mel</li><li>New set of silks, and one for Kelly</li><li>Cool t-shirts (and the like) with crazy Chinese stuff on it</li><li>Feiyue�s for Kelly</li></ul><br /><br />Think that is about it�I am sure there will be more stuff.  I don�t know how this works, having never been to china.  But all anyone ever tells me is how cheap everything is.  <br />
