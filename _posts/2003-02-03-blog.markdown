Socks.  Socks of all things.  Well I would have never thought of that on my own.  I was talking to Qiu Dong last night and he was giving me advice on stuff to bring to china.  He suggested I bring along some gifts to give people over there.  Girls were easy, they like candy and chocolate, but the guys would prefer socks.  Nice brand name ones apparently.  That and T-Shirts.  I figure I will make a run up to target or sports authority and get 2 or 3 cheap, but brand name, shirts and a package or two of Adidas socks.  



I also need to pick up a power converter today.  But that is pretty much all I am gonna need to get for China.  5 days sounds really short.  I have a feeling that it is going to take forever.  



Kelly is getting nervous.  I can tell her worrying it getting to her when she randomly run to the bathroom and hugs the toilet and prepares for emptying her stomach.  Now, that sort of thing worries **me</B>.  I am sure she will be fine, she just doesn't know what to expect, and I don't know what I am going to be doing or where I will be or how I will talk to her.  Well, I have a good idea, but nothing that we can set in stone and be our pre-determined plan.  If there is one thing my wife likes it is a set-in-stone-plan.  I blame that short bald man--her father.
