Tomorrow, tomorrow!  I am all packed up and ready to go.  I got all sorts of medicine and vitamins and clothes and � well, that�s pretty much what I am bringing.  I will check my giant TKD bag and a weapons case with one sword in it (I decided to take my gui ding jian).  Gonna carry on my backpack which has my camera bag and some books in it; and my Timbuktu bag for a change of clothes toiletries and contacts stuff.   <br /><br />Every one kep suggesting stuff for me to bring.  Of course I had a few people remind me (ARG!) to buy them stuff.  Never a �if you don�t mine� or �as long as it�s easy�, but rather a don�t� forget to buy lots of stuff for me.  At least Josh offered to pay.  Emily provided me with one of the afore mentioned phrases, so I am gonna look for some size 37 feiyue�s for her�.can�t for get Kelly is a size 38.  <br /><br />Speaking of that, I asked Kelly what size she wore her feiyues in, and she responded with �Why, I don�t do wushu any more�.  That was very sad.  I always thought she had intended to return sometime in the future, we just were not sure when.  I guess it is fine if she doesn�t ever wanna come back, but it would be nice.  I swear she would like xingyi or bagua, but she swears she hates them.  I am not sure she knows what they are (other than �what Jet Li did in <i>the one</i>).  Sadness.  <br /><br />Who cares!  She still likes sword, and I am going to China!  Of course I really wish she would come with me, and I plan on knocking her over the head, stuffing her in the TKD bag (she will fit, no problem) and taking her with me � but I think it would be a better situation if I paid for a ticket for her and we had a valid visa.  Hmmmm.  Damn.<br /><br />I really need to sneak out of the office for a little while to go up to target and get some razor cartridges, I only have 2, and that is kind of tight for 3 weeks.  Not like a actually need to shave.  I have the facial hair of a square watermelon.  And trust me, that is not a lot.<br />
