Got back from Texas yesterday.  Our plane was on time, so we landed right about 3 � and I actually made it home to change clothes and unload our bags then run off to my 5 o�clock wushu class at Chinese school.  The kids were pretty good, the only problem is the oldest girl is getting a little over confident of her self in that class � she things she has the run of the place and that the rules don�t apply to her.  *sigh* I guess I am gonna just have to smack her back into place.  I did send her off to do horse stance yesterday, but that didn�t seem to change much.  I don�t really get mad at them, but I think I may need to make them think I have gotten mad to provoke the response I want.   I guess I am still verdant enough that I think they will figure this wushu thing out and behave on their own.  I�d be nice if I could actually get some older kids, but if we were gonna do that we would need a second class � It�s not fair to cram them in with 7-8 year old kids that cannot line up with out being yelled at.<br /><br />Texas we fun, my Nana was looking very good despite all the crazy surgery she has partaken of since I have seen her.  Which has been over 3 years, before I got married.  We hung out with my half of the family Saturday afternoon and stayed with them Saturday night.  Kelly�s half was Thursday night/Friday.  It really wasn�t bad going around and seeing all her family, I have at least met them all in the past, which makes this much nicer.  Both of Kelly�s grandparents seem to be doing well. <br /><br />After wushu class sean came over and we went to Lost Dog.  Great place.  It�s a little sandwich and pizza type place, crazy paintings of dogs on the walls and an eclectic menu of oddly named sandwiches.  I got my usual Irish Gyro � feta, lettuce, and beef on a pita. Mmmm.  <br /><br />Job search update:  I got two calls on my answering machine when we got back on Sunday � one from lock-mart and the other from Spherion.  I will let you know if I get an interview after a call them this morning.
