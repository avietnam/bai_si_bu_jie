Finally, I was able to easily pull off a round off-back hand spring-back tuck with no spotter at all.  And it was better than last week -- much cleaner.  Or at least it felt much cleaner.  



Boss man, BRB.



Yep.  It has happened.  I am officially let go.  I am full-time through the 31st and will be part-time through the 15th.   Getting laid off sucks, I think it is worse because I knew it was coming.  Gonna be spending a lot of time down on the CD-R computer saving all my files.  



On the plus side one of my co-workers (okay, former co-worker), mark, has an in for me getting into the Circus.  Kick Boxing Orangutan.  But not just anywhere, in a giant steel sphere with motorcycles driving around us.  If that doesn't work we will set the entire thing on fire.   



It's a sure fire solution.  Either that or I am going to more to china and each English.  Anyone know a weekend course in ESOL?  Maybe I will go get my trainer cert and work at a gym.  Prolly settle into another high stress computer job.  Ugh.



Sword class was pretty good.  I just hate that lightweight cheap sword that coach wants me to use.  I much prefer my guiding one.  If it only made sound.  I think I may take the blade off my guiding sword and swap it with my lightweight one and see how that works.  Perhaps that balance will be fixed and I won't have to smelt any lead.  Plus we all know how crappy the finger guard is on the lightweight swords.  In fact I don't think they should call it a finger guard -- more like a finger hurt.  Because that is what it does.
