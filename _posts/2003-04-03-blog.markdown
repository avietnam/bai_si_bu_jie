Ugh, I am home today -- I have a doctor's appointment at 11.  Sinus infection I think.  I have been coughing up all sorts of interesting things.  Yeah, I will spare you of the details.



Needless to say I skipped wushu last night.  Just didn't feel up to it.  ANd it looks like tonight I will not be going to Wushu or gymnastics.  Mostly that is because of my interview with Lockheed.  It is a bit annoying.  I originally scheduled it for 3 to 5, but I talked to Kim and he said I was gonna be full time this pay period.  So I called lockheed back and rescheduled for 5 to 7. Well, I have 42 hours for 2 weeks -- so i am more like half time.  So 3 to 5 would have been better.  In theory I could have still gone to Wushu -- but if i don't feel well it doesn't matter too much.  Still, I think I am headed out to Waldorf this evening, so I would have been out there earlier (but, that would require driving during rush hour).   I guess what i am trying to say is I am annoyed that I am sick AND unemployed.  In reality my schedule is good.  Plus I got a call form <a href="http://www.ams.com">AMS</a> this morning -- that big consulting firm -- it would be cool to work with them.  Funny thing about that is the location would be across the street from my old apartment -- but even from my current apartment that would not be a bad drive.  



I am gonna go drink hot tea and practice some <a href="http://www.contractjugling.org">contact juggling</a>.



For you mac people out there, <a href"http://hydra.globalse.org/">Hydra</a> rocks.  Good text editor, does everything I need -- but unlike BBEdit it is nice and free.
