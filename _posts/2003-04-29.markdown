Yesterday was my first day, but that was nothing but employee orientation.  Today is my first real day of work -- but I don�t have any real work to do yet.  My Manager is out on vacation and my computer is gonna be completely redone tomorrow, so any changes I make will be whipped out.  Not too much I can do at this point.  Some new employee paperwork and online training and that�s about it.<br /><br />So, I distract my self by looking out the nice big window admiring the trees.  I may be stuck on a conference room on the top floor with all the exec types, but it sure beats a cube in a converted warehouse right next to the projects.  There wasn�t even a window that would let me look out at the projects.<br /><br />Oh, it�s official, Cirque wants me to come show off on the 16th of May.  I have to be at a gymnastics gym in the middle of NYC at 8 a.m. on a Friday morning -- this is gonna be interesting.  I will probably get a hotel up around there, but I still don�t know how or where anything is up there�anyone wanna come with me -- this sorta thing is less nerve racking with company there.  <br /><br />With Cirque fast approaching and my shoulder healing slowly I need to decide if I risk gymnastics and wushu tonight.  My shoulder doesn�t hurt now -- but it �wanted� to hurt yesterday, although it was not painful, merely noticeable.  However Sunday while I was teaching it did hurt quite a bit -- and teaching is rather low impact compared to actual training.  <br /><br />My injuries have bad, bad timing. <br />
