I think acupuncture gives me weird dreams.  I had that schizo dream last Friday after my first session, and last night I had a strange dream where I couldn't open my right eye.  Then my left one started to stick and was getting harder and harder to open.  Not much fun.



Poke me with a needle and call me dumb.  I didn't mention the zip-zangy knee pain until after the acupuncture was all finished and the doctor said I shoulda told him earlier because he could have helped it.  It's crazy cool having a doctor that specializes in Wu Yi (martial arts medicine). 



I wound up going home with out training.  Not that I should be training right after getting treated -- however I don't know for sure because I forgot to ask the doctor if it was ok.  But the people I talked to said I shouldn't.  



I did find the gym in the basement of AMS, pretty nice setup.  They got the free weights and showers that I would want (squat rack, yay!) -- now if I am gonna lift I need a spotter.  But if I wanna go to wushu at lunch I can return and shower before returning to the small conference room.
