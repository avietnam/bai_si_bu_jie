I had a pretty good weekend.  All my forms are set and I am getting pumped for cirque.  T-Minus 4 days.  Not that I am nervous  (I am), but my legs bounce up and down all day long.<br /><br />Friday and Saturday wushu were pretty good, but by Saturday my lower legs were killing me.  If I am not very careful they hurt, but I have gotten to the point that I can prevent the shin pain if I simply condition and train smart.  Pushing for this cirque thing doesn't tend allow me time to worry about my shins.  At least my shoulder and knee are back to normal -- nice happy and pain free. <br /><br />I have only altered my Chang quan form in the second section, took out the butterfly-front sweep and put in a twist.  Unfortunately I don't do a front sweep or body turn in the form now, a couple of things I thought were pretty good.  I want to thro an aerial into my staff form, but I am not sure that the tornado after I do a aerial looks good enough.  If I leave out the aerial my tornado is much better.  So, I will probably just do the plain old staff form.  Sword is not getting changed at all. <br /><br /> The powerful hunger pangs I am having are preventing my creative process so I am gonna go deal with that.  Perhaps I will get inspired and can return to type some inspired-ish words up.   Actually, I will prolly sit pre-occupied with bigger more life changing events.
