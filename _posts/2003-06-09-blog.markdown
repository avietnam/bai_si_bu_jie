Things at work have been going very fast recently.  Or rather I have actually had real work to do.  First important issue, and I think I am handling it pretty well.  I am certain I can make my boss/team happy with the results.  Even with work that causes me to work 14-hour days (last Thursday) I am extremely pleased with my new job.<br /><br />This weekend was pretty hectic.  Friday we had the planned surprise trip to Wolftrap to see Pirates of Penzance � Kelly didn�t figure out what was going on until the last moment.  The cover story worked out well, and we (Jeannie, Kai, and Kelly�s �rents) had a good time.  First night in weeks it didn�t rain, nearly perfect weather for Wolftrap.<br /><br />Saturday I was the only person that trained from 1 to 5 at wushu.  Other people did go to both classes, but they showed up very late (like almost an hour late) to the 1 pm class.  Demo practice was wedged in between regular class and team training.  I was dead by the end of it.<br /><br />So I ran home (late) and jumped in the shower and we headed to Louis�s graduation party in Springfield, some good Mexican food.  Sat and chatted with the in-laws.  Took off early to head to Richmond.<br /><br />We had a free hotel room for the night because of the Marriott points that Kelly earns so we went there instead of my parent�s place.  It was pretty nice, but we were both pretty tired and crashed hard.  <br /> <br />Kelly got up the next morning and went to Target at 8 am to get presents for Laura�s baby shower.  I should have gone with her, she spent lots of money on baby stuff � but she bought me legos so I am not complaining.  After that, breakfast with my parents, lil sister, and Amiee.  The rest of the afternoon I hung out with my dad while the womens went to the shower.<br /><br />Finished the day off with a trip to grandma�s for dinner.  Headed back to NOVA, forgot Kelly�s purse, drove back to Goochland and got it and finally went home for good. <br /><br />At Grandma�s House I got to play with my nephew.  He would jump and spin and kick around � saying �like on TV.�  My sister says he still watches my DVD. He kept asking for �Chris� and I would run over and pay attention to him or play or jump and spin around.  So much fun.  He was even trying handstands after I showed him a few times.  It was great!  Jacob rocks.  I needa make a new DVD for him.
