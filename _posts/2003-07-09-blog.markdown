Ahhh, memories.<br /><br />I stumbled across this as I was cleaning up my server and wanted to post it here for safekeeping.  Plenty of fond memories of the TKD club days.<br /><blockquote><br />Hokido<br /><br />Hokido translates to the Way of the Tiger Energy or the Way of the Tiger Spirit.  However if you pronounce it incorrectly is can easily be thought of as "The way of the Tiger Kids."  All these definitions are acceptable to the founders.  Unfortunately for the reputation of the art we are the founders.  Let me give you the story of how this art came about.<br /><br />A group of Martial artists from Virginia Tech, all of whom had either black belts in Tae Kwon Do or the equivalent in a sister art, attended the VT Tae Kwon Do club.  This club took a trip down to a big tournament in Raleigh NC.  It was at this very tournament that we all attended a lecture from the granddaddy of Tae Kwon Do -- General Choi.  Choi went on to explain who he was and why he has sole rights to the Art of Tae Kwon Do.  He explained how he founded it and if you are not doing exactly what he is doing you are doing karate.  Someone even asked about Kungfu, he said that was karate.  At this point he went on to explain his new Sine wave theory and using arguments that are not founded by any mathematical or scientific means (we are all engineers, BTW).  Making all of his once adoring fans become confused and frustrated.  We were so excited that we were going to hear the founder of the art speak, only to be seared with his condescending sermon.  I am not trying to undermine this man, nor claim is art is poo, I am simply explaining the impression he had on us.  I am sorry if I have offended you.<br /><br />At this point we knew if we did not abide by every thing he had said, that we would not be studying "Tae Kwon Do."  So we decided that we were now studying hokie-do.  (Virginia Tech Hokie's)  This was initially a joke.  We all laughed, but after time Gerald and I continued to claim to practice Hokie-do.  Starting with Our Tae Kwon Do knowledge we applied Jeet Kune Do concepts while force-feeding acrobatics into it.  Making Hokido a labeled version of everything we do.  Much like Bruce Lee invented Jeet Kune Do (please -- don't get me wrong, I am not comparing us to him, that would be an insult to him, rather I am giving credit for the borrowed ideas), and said that take what works for you, well we did.  But unlike Jeet Kune do, we are not purely concerned with fighting arts, Hokido also contains performing arts.  Acrobatics and Gymnastics are just as much a part of Hokido as sparring and ground fighting.<br /><br />We speak lightly of the label "Hokido," but think of it as a goal for our personal refinement.<br /><br />Wow, you made it this far -- I am impressed.<br />Chris.<br /></blockquote><br />And I even stumbled across a couple of things that date back to freshman year.  I think I originally sent these out as emails, but they wound up on the original <i>The Fuzzymonks</i> webpage.<br /><blockquote><br />I would like to clear something up.<br /><br />Many people are confused over what a Ninja really is, and over what a Ninja must do. Ninjas don�t just start out as a great master of deception, buy they must go through many hours of rigorous training and intense pain. For example: I learning to disappear (his s not just a little trick that can be learned over night) Ninjas will spend hours tying to disappear to no avail, and when they finally develop the skill, they are far from perfecting the "disappear." Quite often beginning ninjas will get big nasty blisters from the "little trick." So next time you are talking about the ninjas effortless ability to conquer all members of the animal kingdom, don�t. Remember SANS (that is Secret Agent Ninja Spies) are hard working computer geeks who are bored<br /></blockquote><br />And another!<br /><blockquote><br />Well here I go again, caught up in that giant yo-yo that we call life. Most people complain that there yo-yo won't come back up, just sits there at the end of the string, spinning. Not me--nope, I am different--you will see. I, on the other hand, am that yo-yo that when you yo real hard and try to get that thing to sleep, but I come shooting right back up, and bruise your fingers. My life is an addictive little yo-yo, that will just keep shooting right back up into your hand, till you fingers hurt so much that you just have to switch hands. So as life goes on, and many people just yo, with out the other yo, I will be eating whipped cream and reading safety pamphlets.<br /><br />I will leave you now, for I have wood to melt and a thesis to compose. This is where I leave the intellectuals that aren�t. <br /></blockquote><br />Reminds me of hanging out in the gym with Gerald to 2 a.m. desperately trying to teach ourselves capoeira and stressing about grades.
