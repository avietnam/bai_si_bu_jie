Whammie whammie whammie!<br /><br />Have you seen that Arby's commercial where the Oven Mitt discovers he has no nose?  Well, ya'know how Mr. Mitt runs in a circle screaming after seeing his reflection in the toaster?  That's exactly what I do every time I realize how soon team trials are.  3 days. Not much to do now but walk through, get mentally prepared and rest.  Coach told us all to eat well, no parties, no movies and go to bed before 10pm.<br /><br />The last two days I have felt void of flavor.  Coach says I shouldn't worry.  And I will blame Monday's lack of flair on the Wushu Whammie.<br /><br />For those if you who aren't in the know:<br /><br />Whammie.  <i>n</i>. WAM^-ee. Excessive and frequent evacuation of feces, usually indicating gastrointestinal distress or disorder.<br /><br />One of those times you need a good magazine and at least an hour alone in the bathroom.  Preferably with a can of air freshener.   Wushu whammie is the worse of them all.  <br /><br />On that note ... Well, I donnoï¿½aiya
