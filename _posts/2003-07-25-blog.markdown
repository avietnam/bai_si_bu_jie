Night before.



I am strangly calm, it's 11:30 and I am leaving for NOVA CC at 7:30 or so tomorrow so i am gonna jump in the shower and flop in bed momentarily.



The competitors meeting went well, better than I expected.  Sure the room we did the drawing in was small and hot, but that was only a minor detail. Got to see some old wushu friends -- people I had met in china -- overall it wasn't too stress full.



Oh, as it stands right now I go 16th of 30 in CQ, 9th of 12 in SS, and 3rd of 20 in staff.  Stupid 3rd -- and in my best event.  Overall I am pretty happy about those placements.



I am tired, it was a long day, nice...hot...shower...warm...bed.
