I found out that some people I used to be friends with are now on the other side of the country for a wedding.  I used to call the groom my best friend.  He said it didn't matter what happened we would be friends.  I really did try.  I am despondent now.  Sorry, I needed to be cryptic, I think. Maybe. <br /><br />Friendships used to seem like such a permanent thing to me.  And I don't know why, I grew up an Air Force brat, every 4 or 5 years we would up and move.  Most places we lived I can remember having friends that I swear we wouldn�t loose contact with, but always did.  Maybe they feel permanent because the friendship was always ended because of outside forces, because my parents <b>made</b> me move.  But now it seems like people get mad and that leads to gossip and the produces bickering and other strife.  Once things start going downhill it�s a free for all, faction�s form, people choose sides and we cozen away.  It�s all that part of human nature that ruins politics and allows for reality TV and soap operas.  I wish there was a way to kick that-part-of-human-nature�s ass.  Cause I�d tell some people all the bad things it has done and we�d all get pissed off and gather up some people to beat it up.  <br /><br />Took the day off from wushu yesterday, but Kelly did take me to see <i>Pirates of the Caribbean</i>, which I enjoyed immensely.  It was much better than I expected, and that in and of it self makes for a good movie.<br /><br />Anyone got a copy of <i>Speaker of the dead</i> they wanna give me? I bet B&N does...
