The sadest thing happened last night.  We went to Sweet Water for dinner (that's not he sad part), and I got the jambalaya pasta (also not sad).  Well, I only ate about a 1/3 (no sad) so that I could save the rest for lunch -- well I forgot to take the left over 2/3 home with me.  AIYA!  I seriously stayed up thinking about that $16 meal that I love, yet only got to eat $6 worth.  Hell, I should've tore up a $10 bill.  Or left some jambalaya pasta at the restaurant.  Mmmm, jambalaya pasta.  I'd go get some more, but we are having a hurricane now. <br /><br />Isabelle has been doing her dance up and down the coast and is hitting VA Beach about now.  We otta be hit around 9 pm tonight.  I went in to work for a few hours this morning, yet they kicked  me out about 11.  Then I sat around and watched TV.  It sprinkled a little, is a lil windy, but nothing to write about.  Perhaps the exciting (hopefully not too exciting) part will happen later tonight.<br /><br />Here's to hoping that the Hokies play tonight.  And if they do, that we have power so we can watch the game.
