After the trip I got to sleep in nice and late because I was only working a half-day.  Kelly was the smart one and took the entire day off so she got to stay in her sleepy pants and chill at the house.  I didn't need to go to work, but it was a good idea.  So I did. Actually had stuff to do, so it was a good thing I went.<br /><br />I got my sway bar link for the jeep yesterday, but it was the wrong one.  They sent me a link for a 76-86 CJ, but that won�t work with my TJ, something about leaf springs vs. coils.  Bah.  So I called 4WD back and they said that they don�t have one so I�ll have to go to the dealer.  <br /><br />I went to wushu last night, but skipped gymnastics.  Wushu was pretty good, sword class is always a fun class.  However I get the most frustrated in that class because I think sword is prolly my worst event.  I feel that I just look awkward in sword; I know I competed well with it but I still have quite a ways to go before I will be comfortable with it.  I think I need to video tape it so I can see what I am doing.  Need to remember to take my camera to class. <br /><br />I skipped gymnastics because Kelly called and said she wanted to have dinner with me, normally she is in Richmond on Tuesday nights, plus I was spoiled by being with her every waking moment for the weekend, so I went home to see her.  If I had gone to the gym she would be asleep before I got home and gone by the time I woke up in the morning.  I really wanna work on wall flips though. Next week, plus next week my coworkers say they wanna come.  Great fun.
