Tuesday I went to Galyans to get Kelly's dad birthday present, but I wound up buying 3 Airzookas.  It was pretty funny to wonder around this huge sports/outdoor store with 3 huge bright neon boxes that say AIRZOOKA on them.  But they were on sale, and I can give them away as presents.  Of course I will keep one for my self... <br /><br />I missed wushu because I was going to a happy hour.  It just didn't seem to be a good idea to go to wushu after drinking.  Even though we all know that one guy who does that.  You know who I am talking about.  Yeaaah.<br /><br />I still haven't had a chance to install my sway bar quick disconnects on the jeep.  I am pretty annoyed that I have had them for a couple days but I still drive on that broken linkage.  It's been a good 2 weeks since I noticed it was going, but I simply haven't had time and I need to drive.  So far I have been pretty good about going nice and slow around turns and making sure to be smooth and easy on any freeway maneuvers.  I still don't like it.  I will drive to work tomorrow again on the broken one, and plan on using Kelly's car to get my to the tournament on Saturday, so I will fix it on Sunday.  I hope. I do have Chinese school.  Perhaps I can shoot it with my airzooka.
