Crazy how all my training came to a halt once A, J and P<!--Amina, Jason, Paula-->  showed at wushu.  Much happiness.  I also saw S<!--Stephan--> for the first time since he returned -- S is a beast, he is stepping up his training now that he has gone to china and seen the <i>good</i> stuff.  His first day back and he was teaching 2 classes and training/teaching the third.  Dead-ee-cation. <br /><br />P got me the coolest pants.  I was going to say they were tight, but that didn't sound right in reference to pants.  They are 100% pure Brazilian Capoeira pants, from a good Brazilian friend -- can't beat that with a stick. Jason hooked me up with a 7th world wushu champs shirt, nice shirt, really good quality.  I so wish I coulda gone with them.  I am making a concerted effort to hang with them whenever I can, as their time is limited here.  Even A is leaving for China in a couple months.<br /><br />I had to cut my chillin' with the peeps short because it was time to go see my wife.  Other people might try to lure me with presents but I hadn't seen Kelly much at all over the last week and needed to go get a fix.  I got potpie and brownies out of the deal too.  She even reminded me how to play gin.  I won (but I have my suspicions that foul play was afoot)<br /><br />Too bad I forgot to bring any <i>wo de tai tai de hao chi fan</i> with me today for lunch.
