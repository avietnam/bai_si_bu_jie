I have been a bad wushu student all week.  Sure, I can use the excuse that I hurt my neck playing football and I have stayed away in order to heal, but I still feel like I am slacking.  Last night I skipped long weapon so I could go out with work peeps -- which is a completely valid reason, and was a lot of fun as well.  It�s just sad that we have to say goodbye to our manager.  It�s also sad that he beat me to a pulp playing checkers.  Which brings me to another point.  Urges.<br /><br />I have been having the urge to partake in a number of activitys.  Ont of the being somewhat related to Checkers.  Related in the fact that they are both turn based pure strategy games.  Really wanna play some go.  I also wanna go skating at that park we played foot ball at last weekend.  Oh, yeah, I wanna go play football.  Prolly some touch football because this tackle stuff was just plain silly. I wanna go train (I really wanted to train Wednesday when everyone was going to work on optional) but wushu is nto as high on my <b>just gotta</b> list right now.<br /><br />Agh, actual work.  bbl.
