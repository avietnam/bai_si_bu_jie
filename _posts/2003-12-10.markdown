I raked in the loot:  a new phone, a sweet winter coat, fun electric razor, and the best belt ever.  Gotta give everyone a proper punch in the belly to thank them.  Plus I recieved more phone calls to wish me a happy day than I have ever recieved before.  Super fun. <br /><br />And now a joke:<blockquote>x and e^x are walking down the street. They encounter d/dx, who operates on them. x disappears. e^x survives, thanking the math gods that he is immune to differential operators. While walking on, he encounters another operator coming toward him. "Who are you?" he asks. "I'm d/dy," the operator answers. </blockquote><br /><br />Shuddup, I never said I wasn't a <a href="http://science.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/12/05/1729215&mode=thread&tid=133&tid=186">geek</a>. <br /><blockquote> A neutron walks into a bar and asks "how much for a beer?" The bartender replies "for you, no charge."</blockquote>Yeah yeah, I know.
