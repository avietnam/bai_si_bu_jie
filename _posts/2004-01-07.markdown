Xeno's Paradox is fun:<blockquote>" ... If you travelling from point A to point B, you necessarily must travel half of the distance to point B before travelling all of the distance. Now from that point you must again travel half of the remaining distance. If you continue to do so (travel half of the distance) you will never reach point B. I think this paradox is at the crux of the mysterious digital/analog relationship, but it is a strong argument that reality is digital, meaning that it has a smallest unit. This is because one DOES get to point B, thus at some point we must pass an "unhalvable" point." (<a href="http://www.metaweb.com/wiki/wiki.phtml?title=Einstein%27s_Principle_of_Equivalence">wikipedia</a>) </blockquote><a href="http://www.metaweb.com/wiki/wiki.phtml?title=Einstein%27s_Principle_of_Equivalence">Einstein thought so too</a>, which only adds to the funination.
