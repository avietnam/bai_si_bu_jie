House Shopping.  <br /><br />I think about houses all day, worry about mortgages all night and we drove around looking last night.  We looked at one in Fairfax and a few in Centerville.  The Fairfax one, at a mere $300K was ugly as sin.  Awesome location, nasty price for a ugly house.  Just think of a townhouse built in the early 70s in a development intended to imitate the nice southwestern stucco style nestled in the woods of VA.  It wasn't even a nice looking stucco and tile building, it was just ugly.  <br /><br />There were 2 in Centerville that I would actually consider, but they are so far away from everything.  Well, everything 'cept Jeannie.  Which would really make up for a lot, but, she may be moving in a year and that location would el sucko.<br /><br />I wanna ago drive and look at the places in burke.  Burke is really my first choice, unless something pops up inside the beltway -- but I don't think that will happen in our price range.  <br /><br />Wushu:  Skipped Wednesday for work happy hour (fun with beer and wings), skipped Thursday for house shopping, I may skip tonight (polly not) -- but we got this big demo next weekend so I will log 6 hours of training on Saturday.  I figure once I let coach in on the fact that I am looking for a house she'll be cool.  Of course it is hard for me to improve if I am not training.  At least I have been lifting.<br /><br />Need...food...now...
