Wushu is canceled � I didn�t go yesterday because my left hammie still hurts form a combination of wushu on Tuesday and running with Kelly on Wednesday.  I also didn�t go because I was emotionally and mentally drained from work stuff.  <br /><br />Oh, I also gave myself a fat lip.  I opened my car door into my face.  It hurt.  I felt really stupid.   But that is to be expected if you hit your self in the face with your car door.  <br /><br />Perhaps I will go to wushu tonight and train on my own for a little while.  Jason showed interest in working out earlier.  That seems like a good idea, methinks.<br /><br />More house hunting this weekend, but I feel as if we have moved past the most depressing part of that and things will get better.
