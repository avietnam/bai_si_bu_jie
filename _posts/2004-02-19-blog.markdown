I actually had a very strange experience at wushu last night.  One of the kids there came to me for advice.  Apparently he caught some kids drinking at school and told on them, so now they want to beat him up.   It totally caught me off guard.  I didn't know what to say, he said these bullies were big kids, which have a history of beating up other kids as well as hauling contraband to school.  One interesting side to the story was that some other kids (referred to as "the girls") were also being threatened, because they also told.  



I totally stumbled and didn't know what to say, but I think if I had to do it again, I would advise him to stand up for himself, and especially for the girls.  But never ever do it on their terms - i.e. don't _meet 'em in the boys room_ or _under the bleachers_, but instead if they attack fight back.  Fight back as hard as possible.



Turning the other cheek only works if you have the power to annihilate the aggressor, I don't think that practice was ever intended to be a proper response to school yard bullies.  



Of course I can't verbalize it very well, nor is it original ideas.  This is all stuff I have inherited from my father, and more recently been reaffirmed by John Eldredge.



Still, it is strange to be in a position that the kids approach me and ask my advice.  What have I ever done that impresses upon them that I am a person who might know the answers to their dilemmas.
