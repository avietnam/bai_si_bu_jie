Tuesday night was actually productive.  I started at wushu at 5, and was there till 8, the idea was that I could go give Chad a hand in teaching, but coach started teaching my drunken so he wouldn't let me teach in the hopes that I would get more traditional forms instruction.  Coach taught me some of the basics and I practiced them.  Basics for Drunken are fun.  You mostly stumble in a circle and work on over extending everything.  



Today I attempted to put these basics together into a form.  I have found a couple of videos of zhi cuang and will base my form loosely on those.  However everything seems awkward and, well, silly.  But this is a silly form so I figure I otta embrace this silliness and make it my own.  At least it is fun.



I also want to try to work in a front aerial, seeing as that won't seem like such a girly trick if you are doing drunken.  Just like drunken sword is a men only event, despite the feminine weapon. 



Silly, effeminate, wushu.  Where are my pink silks?



Oh, wait I am not that good yet.  One day--oh yes--one day I too will be able to don the silky pinkness, and I will wear it as a badge of honor. 



Does that sound wrong to anyone else?  Sometimes I swear I picked the wrong damn sport.  Perhaps Krav is not such a bad idea.
