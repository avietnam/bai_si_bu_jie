I went and visited Paula in the hospital yesterday.  She was being monitored because they found blood clots in her lungs.  Apparently the clots formed in her leg when she ripped the hell out of her MCL/ACL, then the doctor told her not to move at all if she wants her MCL to heal, so she kept it a minimum of movement (bathroom trips, twice a day).  Now she has sharp chest pains.  Luckily she should be fine and out of the hospital in a couple of days.  I�ll be praying that her knee gets all better soon.  Poor girl.  Stupid tornado-horsestance on puzzle mats. <br /><br />It has been a pretty hectic day actually.  As soon as I got in B mentioned that I must not check my voicemail, and guess what, I don�t, so I had a message form him saying don�t� come up--lets just go to the mechanic.  So instead I just headed right back down and then we want off to the car connection.  We picked up one the car from one shop and drove across town to drop it off.  I was starving.  We didn�t eat.  I called Kelly and her mom was coming into town so they could go measure and look at paint samples in the new house.  Well, not wanting to be left out I insisted on joining them, unfortunately  the only restaurant we know of in Burke is McDonalds, so we met there (we were supposed to meet at the house, but I was late).  I ate a 10 piece McNuggets.  They had salad.  I regret it now.  We went and played at the house, and that was fun.  I like Bandit, the grey and white cat that can go outside, who was all affectionate and purr-in�.  Now I feel really tired and it is lonely in my office as all the people I know are gone.  I think I will go home and take a nap.  ...zzzZZZZzzzZZZzzz...zzz......
