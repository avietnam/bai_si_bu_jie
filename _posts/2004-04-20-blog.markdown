Paint paint paint.  If I ever seen another roll of that blue tape again it will be too soon.  <br /><br />Actually I am really happy with how everything has turned out; it�s too bad that the living/dining room is the only completely finished room in the house.  The bedroom, kitchen and office need trim painted.  The office could probably use another coat of that bothersome maroon.  I don�t recommend painting anything maroon.  It will take a lot of coats.  I am up to 3 now, and it needs more.  <br /><br />Ok, the quick rundown of the colors:<br />Kitchen:  Pink baby!<br />Living/dining Room:  Light blue and lighter blue on different walls, except the striped wall.  That wall rocks. <br />Bedroom:  A soothing green, with grayish tendencies. <br />Office:  Pure Hokie, Orange and maroon.  Orange is easy to paint. <br /><br />We have hauled most of our stuff over already, I went ahead and canceled our truck for the first, mostly because we have 3 big things left to haul (couple of dressers and a bed, easy) and then we are stuck with little crap.  <br /><br />Moving sucks, but owning a house is awesome.  I like being in the house and thinking, I own you. OWN YOU, BIATCH! Succeeding in obtaining a living space that is not the routine, colorless, vapid builders white that we have lived in for 8+ years is a very good thing.  Even the furniture looks better.  <br /><br />I was completely exhausted this past weekend, it is nice to be back at work where I am not consistently lifting things that are heaver than, say, me.
