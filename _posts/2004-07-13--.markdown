<a href="http://www.homestarrunner.com/expfilm.html">A HSR cartoon that is a TMBG video about making indy movies.</a>  The only thing they are missing is Kung fu fighting. Other than that it is perfect.  <br /><br /><br /><br />And now an Everett memory:<br /><br /><i>When I bite into a York Peppermint Patty I get the sensation of pouring Listerine all over my genitalia</i><br /><br />Where is Everett?  I needa call him.  I have an Everett shaped hole in my psycho.  Not psyche, psycho.<br /><br /><br /><br /><img src="http://fuzzymonk.com/photos/blog/image/595/mrsnapy.jpg" align="left" />Oh, I saved a turtle from certian death by big suvs in burke yesterday.  On my drive home I noticed a small pile of leaves walking slowly across Lake Braddock--once I decided that leaves don't walk, or have hard outer shells I thougth that turtle was in danger from all the poor drivers in the area.  Teenaged kids soccer moms in trucks.  So I slammed on the brakes, threw it in reverse and jumped out to save Mr. Snappy.  He tried to run, but my moderatly brisk walk enabled me to catch him and haul him back down to the creek.  Honestly, I think he was annoyed.
