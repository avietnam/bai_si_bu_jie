  <p class="MsoNormal">I finished my sword form yesterday. <span style=""> </span></p>     <p class="MsoNormal">We went to lunch with Coach at her husband's restaurant and were talking wushu for a couple of hours. <span style=""> </span>Which basically got me all psyched up about finishing my sword form, which up to this point was only the opening movements. <span style=""> </span>So I talked Stephan (who had trained once that day with <st1:country-region st="on"><st1:place st="on">Chad</st1:place></st1:country-region>) into coming over and watching wushu vids for a little while before we went to train.<span style="">  </span>All sword and spear stuff.<span style="">  </span>Once we had a few ideas we ran over to the school to try and put a form together. <span style=""> </span>With Stephanï¿½s help I was able to finish the entire thing. That man is a crazy natural sword form maker-upper. He has so many different, and cool, movements in his sword vocab that he can just pull one out at anytime for anything. <span style=""> </span><a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/vine/showthread.php?t=350407">I added in a combo from Shi Kun</a>, plus some other stuff that has been butchered so much that I am certain the athletes that originally made it up could not tell. <span style=""><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span></p>     <p class="MsoNormal">Overall I am really happy with my form.<span style="">  </span>Between Me, Stephan and Sara we were able to make a pretty original form. <span style=""> </span>Now I just gotta get my 720 tornado to horse stance that I need for it. <span style=""> </span>And 540 jump outside.<span style="">  </span>And double sweep.<span style="">  </span>Aiya. </p>
