We took the kittens for  their second visit to the vet today.  Much easier with two people there to handle them.  Our vet was caught up in a bit of an emergency so we were in the little waiting room for a little while.  They did the normal suspicious exploring, but Henry took it one step further by licking the soap.  Not a bar of soap, but that the soft-serve pump liquid hand soap. He was licking like crazy and making faces for a while.  He then proceeded to produce copious amounts of drool.  I took a tissue and wiped the drool off only to be have a cat that started to foam at the mouth.  Not like a normal "barking dog" type foaming, but more like hand dishwashing liquid in a dishwashing machine.  Once I wiped his whole mouth out with a tissue a few times (leaving little clumps of tissue stuck on his cat like tongue) he seemed to return to normal.  <br /><br />The shots and other medicine that followed were totally uneventful.
