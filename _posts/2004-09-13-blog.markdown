I find my self stressing about work.  I have been her over a year, but in the past that is about as long as I stay at a job before they give me the "it's not you it's me" speech. <br /><br />Prolly just paranoid.  <br /><br />Today at lunch I decided that when I have kids I need to replace the word <i>ut-oh</i> with something more interesting.  Ben suggested <i>formaldehyde</i>.  So every time the baby dropped something they would say <i>formaldehyde</i>!  That way when they play the I'm gonna make daddy pick up stuff game they love to play it will at least be interesting for the unsuspecting by-standers.<br /><br />I feel there is no need to point out that we watched a young boy in a stroller drop a set keys repeatedly while chanting "ut-oh."<br /><br />Heel, heel go away.  I am really annoyed today.
