I had the best breakfast ever.  The buffet at the La Casa restaurant is great fun.  Lets recap with:<br />Fried Bananas<br />Breakfast Nachos<br />Chef's Specialty (Mexican pulled pork?)<br />Refried Beans<br />Papas<br />Pitas<br />Hummus<br />Croissants<br />French Bread<br />Strawberry Marmalade<br />Apricot Preserves<br />Bacon<br />Quesadillas<br />Smoked Salmon<br />Chocolate Milk<br />Orange Juice<br />Watermelon Juice<br />Papaya Juice<br /><br />Nest best thing is the pool with a bar in it.  The pool has a bar in it.  Great idea.  White sand, warm ocean.  I am not going to go home.
