Tomorrow we return home.  Pfftt.  At home kelly dosn't get a random assortment of sunburn stripes.  And we can't get hamburgers and froofy drinks in the pool.<br /><br />Eastland and Harry's (aka Isla Mujares) and Chicken Pizza (Chichen Itza) make this place really cool.<br /><br />Too many First Fitness people bragging about how great their wares are and how we sould join the cult.<br /><br />Paying for internet sucks, so I get back to this later.<br /><br />"Hasta la vista, babies." -Jimmy the tour guide.
