Last night Kelly made me watch football instead of Monday night stargate.  Eventually she went up stairs and fell asleep leaving me downstairs alone to watch the game.  I coulda watched stargate, but at that point I was into the game and had to finish it.  Up past midnight watching pro ball and our team lost.  Stupid professionals.  <br /><br />The fun part was when Kelly showed up to wushu after she working out/shopping.  I happened to be standing outside unsuccessfully trying to break into a car with a coat hanger.  We went back into wushu and I trained a little more while she told me how hungry she was.  Eventually she drove Jennifer home and I stopped at Xi Shang Fan for some tasty gan bian si ji duo and gung pao ji (bu ma ti).  They didn't put in the ma ti so I was a happy guy.  <br /><br />Right now I want some Chinese food so I am not thinking of how bad my front sweeps sucked last night.  At least I did an aerial twist.<br /><br />Three cheers for tivo! Buh-doop Ba-doop Bi-dip!<br />
