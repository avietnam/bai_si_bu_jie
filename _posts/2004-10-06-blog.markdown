I took the tickle.com IQ test and got a 133. It said:<blockquote>Your IQ score is 133 



This number is based on a scientific formula that compares how many questions you answered correctly on the Classic IQ Test relative to others. 



Your Intellectual Type is Visual Mathematician. This means you are gifted at spotting patterns — both in pictures and in numbers. These talents combined with your overall high intelligence make you good at understanding the big picture, which is why people trust your instincts and turn to you for direction — especially in the workplace. And that's just some of what we know about you from your test results. </blockquote>

And then from <a href="http://aistis.raudys.name/iq.html">here</a><a href="http://cgi.eaglecentre.force9.co.uk/blog/archives/000295.php">:</a><blockquote>Average: 85 - 115

Above average: 116 - 125

Gifted Borderline Genius: 126 - 135

Highly gifted and appearing to be a Genius to most others: 136 - 145

Genius: 146 - 165

High Genius: 166 - 180

Highest Genius: 181 - 200

Beyond being measurable Genius: Over 200</blockquote>Why must everything I do be so damn borderline.  Oh, I know, it's cause I take online  IQ tests.
