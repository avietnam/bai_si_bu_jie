<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A26740-2004Nov4.html">Wushu in the post</a><br /><br /><br /><br />Learn Wushu<br /><br />Sunday, November 7, 2004; Page M03<br /><br /><br /><br />The movie "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" featured an epic love story, poisonous darts and graceful, gravity-defying swordplay, with lithe warriors battling each other in midair by ricocheting off walls, leaping off roofs and soaring among treetops. Although the flying was courtesy of stunt masters and cinematic special effects, there is a real martial art buried under the glitz: wushu, a modern, acrobatic variant of kung fu that is gaining in popularity locally and worldwide.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Wushu is the national sport of China -- in 2008, it'll be introduced as an event at the Beijing Olympics. While kung fu sticks to the traditional moves, wushu constantly evolves, adding more tricks, twists and turns. Advanced feats include running up a wall and flipping back down, a 720-degree spinning tornado kick and a butterfly kick that resembles a sideways-twisting layout -- all making the sport a perfect base for the gymnastics of Hong Kong action movies.

As its popularity has increased, though, participants have become more diverse.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />What to Expect: Your first class won't involve any fancy gymnastics or sword fighting. In fact, though wushu is a martial art, students generally aren't allowed to learn sparring until the higher levels. Instead, you'll stretch and learn the basic straight-leg kicks, such as the front and side stretching kick and the outside and inside crescent kicks. Wushu emphasizes a straight back and extended arms, so you may come away with mild soreness in those areas. Impatient athletes shouldn't fret, though: Depending on dedication and ability, it's possible to start trying acrobatics, like butterfly kicks, after about six months.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />What to Bring: Shorts, a T-shirt and a clean pair of sneakers. Unlike other martial arts, wushu is not done in bare feet.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Cost: Your first two introductory classes can be had for $15 to $19. After that, weekly or semiweekly classes cost just over $100 per month, depending on the school.
