Thursday or Friday night I was driving home at night in the dark.  It was raining.  I was on the beltway.  The strange part was the suicidal frogs that were making a break for it across the beltway.  I could not figure out how they made it over the median.  I felt horrible for slaughtering so many apparently stupid frogs.



Maybe it is payback for the good deed of saving Capt. Snappy the Box Turtle from Lake Braddock Dr.  



I later figured out that it was not frogs at all.  But leaves in the wind and rain.  I guess the wind/water ratio was perfict for imitating a frog hop.  Really freaked me out at the time. 



Sorta like when I was getting really tired and thought I saw an ostridge on the side of the road.



Kelly and I finally had a weekend at home with no serious commitments.  Saturday was a polite wushu class and a pants-peeing good time at the Tullos house.  Even though most people <a href="http://www.cheapass.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&Store_Code=CAG&Product_Code=CAG530">didn't have pants</a>.



After church on Sunday I met up with Stephon and we finished up some shooting for the demo video we have been working on.  I started shooting video earlier this week in class, jumps, sections, etc.  So we met up when we had some extra time to finish some stuff up.  We filmed for 2 hours or so--just pure wushu, no choreo--and came back to my house to edit it.  Half way through the log 'n capture process Stephon pointed out that this takes a long time.  Heh.  Our demo vids are long from complete, but in the mean time I have posted <a href="http://www.jianshu.net/media/StephonPredemo.mpg">Stephon's Pre-demo</a>.



I also reposted <a href="http://www.fuzzymonk.com/media/omeitwists.mpg">O-Mei Twists</a> now that I no longer have my .mac account.
