<span style="font-weight:bold;">What I did at work today.</span><br /><br /><br /><br /><img src="http://fuzzymonk.com/photos/blog/image/595/Chair_Chris02.jpg" /><br /><br />squeezing though the arm of a chair!<br /><br /><br /><br /><img src="http://fuzzymonk.com/photos/blog/image/595/Chair_Chris03.jpg" /><br /><br />Hurts real bad. And I have a big butt.<br /><br /><br /><br /><img src="http://fuzzymonk.com/photos/blog/image/595/Chair_Tom02.jpg" /><br /><br />Tom could do it too.  <br /><br /><br /><br /><img src="http://fuzzymonk.com/photos/blog/image/595/Chair_ChrisTom.jpg" /><br /><br />Then we raced.  I lost.  Tom won easy because he thought ahead and took off his belt.<br /><br /><br /><br /><img src="http://fuzzymonk.com/photos/blog/image/595/Chair_Tom08.jpg" /><br /><br />Tom up's the ante and goes for the 2fer.<br /><br /><br /><br /><img src="http://fuzzymonk.com/photos/blog/image/595/Chair_Tom09.jpg" /><br /><br />He said it was scary.  I said it was funny.  Ben did work.<br />
