Cory from wushu is the coolest guy ever.  Best burrito is a free burrito.  Especially if it has black beans, carnitas, green tomatillo and sour cream. Cory, if you ever stop by my work I will give you free lines of code.  Or a postit.  Oh, the OC night would be better if we didn't have to watch the apprentice.  Or the OC for that matter--which was absolutely with-out-a-doubt ridiculous.  Itâ€™s bounding over predatory sea life.
