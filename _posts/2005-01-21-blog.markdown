Cory from wushu is the coolest guy ever.  Best burrito is a free burrito.  Especially if it has black beans, carnitas, green tomatillo and sour cream. Cory, if you ever stop by my work I will give you free lines of code.  Or a postit.  Oh, the OC night would be better if we didn't have to watch the apprentice.  Or the OC for that matter--which was absolutely with-out-a-doubt ridiculous.  It's bounding over predatory sea life.

We are going to Baltimore.  It is supposed to snow.  We may be in Baltimore for some time.  I just posed to t notice that omei will be closed.  I have a feeling some bad stuff is about to go down.
