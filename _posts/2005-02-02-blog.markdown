Kelly got two nicely framed Monet posters and I got a iPod shuffle. Why? Early valentines mostly. It was also hard to hide two big ole, huge old, pictures with out Kelly finding them.<br /><br /><br /><br /><img src="http://fuzzymonk.com/photos/blog/image/595/ipodshuffle.gif" align="left" />Now I must wait a full month for the iPod fun can begin.  So sad.  So long. Not fair, kelly can listen to her framed posters all she wants.<br /><br /><br /><br />Tuesday was an interesting day.  Started off with chaos. Let's recap:<br /><br /><br /><br /> * Phone ringing for a cab we didn't order, twice<br /><br /> * Loud getting ready by my wife<br /><br /> * Turning on of bedside lamp by my wife <br /><br /> * Phone ringing due to frantic wife and sheets of ice<br /><br /> * Crying wife<br /><br /> * Cats attempted suicide while I was lifting<br /><br /> * Cats breaking a bowl while I showered<br /><br /> * Discovered shards of glass on my freshly showered bare feet<br /><br /> * Work (wont compile and this time the errors are <i>more</i> cryptic!)<br /><br /> * No training, must go eat dinner with kelly's coworkers<br /><br /> * Show up at a fancy pants hotel, go to room, wife leaves<br /><br /> * Sit in the hotel lobby<br /><br /> * Get informed that VP's are getting kicked out of the party so chances of me getting in are slim<br /><br /> * Sit in the upstairs lobby, play scrabble<br /><br /> * Get free steak dinner(!)<br /><br /> * Spend the night in the hotel room wondering what the cats are breaking<br /><br /><br /><br />But steak and a hearty <i>atta boy</i> from work for kelly make for a good day.<br /><br /><br /><br />**half this post written by the wife<br /><br />
