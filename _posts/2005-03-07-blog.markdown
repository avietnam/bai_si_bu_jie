OK, I am gonna make a <i>Krav**</i> Mix CD, and I want a proper full 80 minuite CD.  Full hard rock pumped-for-fighting stuff.  I so I did what I should and consulted Neal.  Here is the working list so far:<br /><br /> * Dead Cell and Blood Brothers, both by Papa Roach<br /> * Awake and I Stand Alone, both Godsmack<br /> * My Hero, Foo Fighters<br /> * Defy You, Offspring<br /> * Paint it Black, Earth Crisis (cover)<br /> * Fuel, Metallica<br /> * Immortal, Adema<br /> * Points of Authority, Linkin Park<br /> * Taste the Red Hands, Dead Poetic<br /> * Whisper, Evanescence<br /> * Nice Guys Finish Last, Green Day<br /> * Motorbreath, Metallica<br /> * Down With The Sickness, Disturbed<br /> * Fight Fire with Fire, Met.<br /> * Still Waiting, Sum 41<br /><br />**According to Sean they rock the hard core stuff while training hard core at Krav, so thus it is <i>krav</i> music.
