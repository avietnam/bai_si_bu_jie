OK, I am gonna make a _Krav\*\*_ Mix CD, and I want a proper full 80 minuite CD.  Full hard rock pumped-for-fighting stuff.  I so I did what I should and consulted Neal.  Here is the working list so far:



 * Dead Cell and Blood Brothers, both by Papa Roach

 * Awake and I Stand Alone, both Godsmack

 * My Hero, Foo Fighters

 * Defy You, Offspring

 * Paint it Black, Earth Crisis (cover)

 * Fuel, Metallica

 * Immortal, Adema

 * Points of Authority, Linkin Park

 * Taste the Red Hands, Dead Poetic

 * Whisper, Evanescence

 * Nice Guys Finish Last, Green Day

 * Motorbreath, Metallica

 * Down With The Sickness, Disturbed

 * Fight Fire with Fire, Met.

 * Still Waiting, Sum 41



\*\*According to Sean they rock the hard core stuff while training hard core at Krav, so thus it is _krav_ music.
