The Flu<br /><br />Kelly has the flu for sure, her doctor actually did a test and confirmed it. My doctor thinks I have  asinus infection, but I am not totally convinced.  I have nearly all the same symptoms.  Maybe it's a sinus infection AND the flu.<br /><br />Either way, life sucks right now. <br /><br />Kelly's mom is so nice.
