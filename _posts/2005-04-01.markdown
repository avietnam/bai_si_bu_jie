<a href="http://www.bbspot.com/News/2004/04/top_11_geek_bachelor_party.html">Signs You're at a Geek Bachelor Party</a><br />11. The guys spend three hours breadboarding an LED counter to keep track of how many shots the bachelor drinks.<br />10. Someone yells "first post," but they aren't reading slashdot.<br />9. Everyone refers to each other by their instant messenger names.<br />8. You give the groom "Sam's Teach Yourself Tantric Love-making in 28 Days."<br />7. You are the only human male in a hot tub full of female Klingons, but you are skinnier than all of them.<br />6. None of the friends are able to provide the groom with any first-night tips based on their own experience.<br />5. When the stripper asks, if you have protection, you show her your firewall.<br />4. Someone yells "bang tail" in order to indicate a shell command should be repeated in order to view a log file.<br />3. The stripper trips over lan cables and breaks her leg.<br />2. Attendees reminisce about the good times they had in Ultima Online.<br />1. Frequent cries of "<a href="http://www.fuzzymonk.com/media/dungeons-and-dragons-part1.mp3">I'm going to shoot Magic Missiles at the darkness!</a>"<br /><br />#'s 11, 10, 4 and 1: classic. Needed some H*R related ones too.<br /><br /><i>More like you write a book about comeback jokes.  NERD!</i>
