I know Tom is going to be disappointed, but I am just getting new silks and not making a costume for a new Robin Hood play.<br /><br />We get to make the new style of silks and have the option of designing my own, and well, I prefer to have original silks.  <br /><br />Consider for a moment those people who wander into a tattoo parlor and pick a tattoo design from one of the designs on the wall.  How thoughtless and trite it seems.  Well, silks are for running around on the carpet, and nowhere near as permanent -- or even as meaningful as a statement of my beliefs.  Nevertheless, I would like to have something not so cookie cutter.<br /><br />Here is my design:<br /><img src="http://www.fuzzymonk.com/albums/wushurelated/newsilksGoldNavy.thumb.gif"><br />Gold and Navy<br /><img src="http://www.fuzzymonk.com/albums/wushurelated/newsilksGreyBurgundy.thumb.gif"><br />Grey and Burgundy<br /><br />I think I am going gold and navy because the burgundy silk tends to be real purple when they dye it. I did not think of sub-zero until someone pointed it out to me. Arg.
