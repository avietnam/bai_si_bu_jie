I am still a bit skeptical, I feel like this is some sort of elaborate joke at my expense. But according to the certificate they handed me I am on the team. So much invested in this thing and it just doesn't feel real. I cringe at the idea of how this is going to get twisted and turned into a political issue, but I am going vietnam either way.  So tired.  And hungry.
