Good job everybody, and thank you Kelly.



It is weird hearing everyone congradulating me, and it defnitaly hasn't sunk in.  But the past two years havce been all for this one thing and I got it, so you know that feels good.  Hearing some of the parents remambering how I went back to training the day after TT03 and saying how all the hard work paid off was really something.



O-Mei really worked their asses off and is showed.  Jump training all winter, choragraphy finized in december and january, Li Ying Kue coming back out to rechoreograph our forms into what the judges would want.  Good job guys.



I am at a loss for for words.  So I put a few pictures up in the gallery.
