I made the media shelf.  Beej scared me when he asked 'is it wide enough,' but I am pretty sure it is.  I measured my old TV stand for dimentions and it measured 19", so I made the opening 20", but then decided that I wanted drywall on the inside of the opening so I am back down to 19", more like 18 1/2" counting the spackle.  Make me a little nervious, but I went and measured a my reciever and DVD player and they all seemed to be a nice polite 17" or 18".  Knock on wood.

Mud and tape, all day long.  Mud mud mud while I sing this song. Tomorrow, sanding.
