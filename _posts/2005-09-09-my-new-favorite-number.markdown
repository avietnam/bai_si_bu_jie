is 8,006,008,977.<br /><br />I love the direct line to the costumer retention department.  I called and chatted with Aaron for a wile, we talked aobut football, scifi, nascar, college and computers for a wile and he hooked me up with a sweet deal. I understand that I prolly could have gotten some more out of him, but I figure the $299 (minus the $100 rebate) for the HR10-250 was a good deal.  Beej was happy with his $699 and a $200 credit at directv.  When I told him about my deal he didn't beleave me.<br /><br />beej: 299 HD Tivo? <br />me: correct<br />beej: i cant believe it<br /><br /><img src="http://www.directv.com/images/imagine/hddvr/header.gif"><br /><br />All said and done it is $199 (+tax, stupid the man).  Bully!
