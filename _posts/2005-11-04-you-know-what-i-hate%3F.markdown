MFC.<br /><br />Must stand for <span style="font-weight:bold;">M</span>acros are <span style="font-weight:bold;">F</span>reakin <span style="font-weight:bold;">C</span>onfusing.  Or maybe <span style="font-weight:bold;">M</span>icrosoft <span style="font-weight:bold;">H</span>ates <span style="font-weight:bold;">P</span>rogrammers.<br /><br />Wait, you say MHP is not the same acronym as MFC?  Well<br /><br />#define MHP MFC<br /><br />There!  Son of a precompiler macro. <br /><br />Who thought it would take me 3 hours to figure out how to get a pointer to the Check Box Control?  Who knew it was becasue you have to cast the pointer to a CButton?
