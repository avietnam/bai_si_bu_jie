So far worlds is nothing but crazy balled up, squished down and throw right in your face.



We got here and found out that we missed the first day of training, where the rest of the team was able to get in a few hours of good working out in.  For some, it was too good.  Phillip and Jason both hurt themselves on that day.  I believe they both did it on the new style carpet that was out.  Phil rolled his ankle really bad on an aerial and Jason tweaked his knee a little on the gui bu landing after a tornado. Both moves they can do in their sleep.  So the next day when Stephon and I actually were able to train with them we all were a little cautious.  The tricky thing was all the judges were sitting in the stands watching us, so we had to go for it enough to impress them, but not get hurt.  



The organizing committee here is prolly the real source of the aforementioned crazy, we have a couple of liaisons that are supposed to go to bat for us, but on our experience they don't really step up to the plate.  For example, when we showed up for training they wanted us to use the warm-up rooms, the guard man wouldn't let us pass.  Our helper lady didn't question anything and just insisted that we go to the warm-up room-the guard said there was no training going on, it was just a meeting.    Luckily we had Jason walk past the stairs the guard was at and use the ramp to get up there, because there was plenty of training going on.  Eventually we all made it into the arena, but only after walking around the long, stinky way. 



While we were at the arena we were able to see out events schedule and the order we will compete.  I had a fun sinking feeling when I saw my name on the top of the list for men's chang quan.  I was only reassured that this was worlds, its not like team trials where your order is inversely proportional to your score (oh, BTW, after watching competition this morning, all reassurances have been nullified).  We also found that Phil was down for the wrong events and Stephon and I were not on the list for dui lian.  



We spoke to Lu Xiao Lin and she was able to get our names added to the dui lian list.  Apparently the IWuF had us registered and simply forgot us on that list.  Phil was not so lucky; according to the IWuF the USAWKF registered him for Staff and Broad Sword, not Straight Sword like he wanted.  This really sucks, mostly that he won't get to compete in the event he trained in, but because they instantly blamed sifu--even though she was fighting for them.  I just find it so frustrating that is the knee jerk reaction.



As frustrating as this Phil sword thing is (on top of a bad ankle) everything is going well, the team is cheering hard for each other, and we are all getting along.  One U.S. Team, here representing our country.  And I don't know about my teammates, but I think that representing is a pretty kick-ass thing.  Meeting all the players from all over the world, people from everywhere-Lebanon, South Africa, Turkey-lots of places you don't think of when you think wushu. Plus, being able to compete with the top athletes from places like Japan, China, and Macao is absolutely surreal.   I don't feel like I should be given this honor, I don't think I am going to embarrass my self, but this situation was a dream I worked hard for but never truly considered that I would make it.  After being crushed in 01 to miss that 12th spot by a hundredth, I justified it away.  Now I am in this crazy country of mopads and a very weird language that I cannot begin to understand and I am doing it.  



It is all very real now. It is going to be way too real when I am walking onto that carpet first tomorrow.  Lets hope I can turn it on for another 1:20 then. 



Ok, enough cheesy crap-o. Taxi's are boring and expensive(er).  Mopeds are cheaper and way more fun.  It is not as fast as it looks, and its true you are pressed up against a less than clean person, but it is silly fun.
