Really really dirty.<br /><br />I am taking pictures to show friends and family back home, but that is not going to convey it.  If I had scratch and sniff pictures with all smells then maybe they would get an idea of what is going on here.  Often stinky and dirty go together.<br /><br />I compete again tomorrow.  I am pretty tired today, so I will need some good sleep tonight. I don't think I go on until the evening, so I can get up chear for Jason, take a nap, and head down for some jianshu. Stephon is first in our division, and I am 8th, so we will get it done and over with early.  Once that happens I need to concentrate on duilian so I don't make the stupid mistakes like we did during our day of training.<br /><br />Oh, I talked to Steve Coleman, the changquan guy from Great Brittan, and yes we did tie--and we both got 15th place.  15th in the biggest event at here, upwards of 80 athletes in that thing.  Yes, this is bizarro Hanoi.<br /><br />Time to go chear Zach on for daoshu.  (U-S-A JIA YOU!)
