I was playing with the camera last night, and the cats provided by far the most interesitng subject, so I took more picutres of them again.  I also got a few of the dubya gnome, but cats are much more fun to look at.  <br /><br /><img src="http://fuzzymonk.com/photos/cats/image/595/exphenry.jpg" class="picture"><br /><br />Henry under the table.  Nice warm colors.  Check out the reflections in the eyes.  <br /><br /><img src="http://fuzzymonk.com/photos/blog/image/595/expampere.jpg" class="picture"><br /><br />Cool, cool ampere chillin' in the blue chair.<br />
