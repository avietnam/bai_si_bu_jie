My boss commented on my new kicks today and asked if I did actually play indoor soccer.  I had to say no.  And nope, I don't watch it either.  But if you break the shoes in real good you can use them for wushu.  <br /><br />Kelly pointed out that I could play indoor soccer, and then I wouldn't be a poser.  So I have the potential for not being one, but, currently I am.<br /><br />Anyone know where I can get the Ris paul ric CD?  I have only found one place to order it, but I would rather buy it a brick and mortar establishment.  Of course I have waited so long for the instant gratification that if I did it the non-instant way I would be currently gratified. <br /><br />Chinese New Year is this weekend (Sunday) so I have demos.  I am currently officially slated for on at Mason on Saturday night, and there are rumors of one on Sunday afternoon, but I have yet to receive official word on that yet.  I had been planning on going downtown with Duane to taka some pictures.<br /><br />A parting gift: Resistance may be futile, but capacitance has potential.
