Who knew things could go so smootly.



The basement project at Ft. Truxion has met its final milestone.  No more 70's nasty wood paneling and yellow bar. Plus it is politely tucked away in the corner behind you as you enter the room, as if to say this room does not belong in a frat house. 



We got some prefab cabinets form home depot, but as you can see the wall we decided to put the bar on has this nifty little bump out for the drain stack.  No big deal.  Or, at least that is what you think until you buy prefab cabinets and need place them against the wall with the bump out.  So Saturday Kelly's dad and brother came over to 1) bring me clamps and 2) clamp stuff.  We assessed the situation.  We built the cabinets ikea style.  We made mean faces at the bump out.  



Eventually Rich and I decided this is going to be done right and we unfabbed the center 18" cabnet to straddle the bump out.  This is where things normally deteriorate into crumbling particle board and ripped out hardware, but this time was different.  The higher powers decided that they would smile upon us, everything went smoothly.  It was a barrage of clamping and sawing, sawing and clamping.  We cut out the grooves for that piece of masonite that slides in the back, we adjusted everything nicely and even located the quick connect hardware that they supplied.  In the end we had a nice inverted 'P' shaped cabnet (I guess that could be a lower case 'd' shape) that hugged the oddly shaped wall.  By the time rich left he was wondering around muttering to himself (and anyone else who would hear) how amazing this was.  I had to agree, there was no way that worked as well as it did. I didn't want to say anything.  I felt like we were looking at a shut out and I would jinx it if we said something. 



Rich took off once the cabinet was done, but Neal-o hung around to help me with the countertop.  Which was a good thing due to the constant tango or prancing the 8' slab of particle board and laminate out to the patio for the clamps/saw and then marching it back in to check the most recent cut.  It wasn't until Sunday did I go and buy a wood/laminate specialty blade for my jigsaw.  Astounding how much different the blades can make.  Unfortunately I already made the cuts for the bump out and sidewall--which are exposed --with the regular wood blade.  However the sink cut out--covered by the sink--is super clean.  Ahh, I can cover them with a bit of quarter round and none will be the wiser.  



Sunday was two trips to home depot, plumbing and the pretty details of the counter and cabinets (stuff like the laminate end caps, kick boards and doors).  Besides having to get creative with the drain the plumbing went smooth. I had a grand total of zero leaks in the feed lines.  I have a bit of a drip from the trap, but that is directly related to my aforementioned creativity.  One more trip to the h-d and I should be good.  I guess that answers my question about the j-trap being mounted backwards.  It truly does matter.

The other notable event of the weekend (a.k.a. the time I wasn't being bossed around by a pregnant lady in a foof\*) was Luke's 1st birthday.  We showed up and Katie said there were a bunch of people there we would recognize.  First one I recognized was Sara Free.  I had no idea the Free Clan was going to be there, but they were--all 4 of them.  It's amazing how big the kids are.  We basically spent the evening hanging out with the college friends that we hadn't seen in way too long.  Todd and Marilee only live across the river, but we don’t see them nearly as much as we should. We hung out, played with some crazy hyper kids, ate cake, helped Luke open presents and watched the Muppet Show on Beej's giant TV.  By the end of the night we were falling asleep, but I wanted to stay as long as I could be because of the people there.

\*Ok, so she did everything I asked and repeatedly offered to help, but that doesn’t make for a good story does it?
