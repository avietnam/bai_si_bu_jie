They might be giants, the best band of all time, is comign to DC to play at the 9:30 club.  I thought I would envite Everett along since he is also a huge fan.  And we had a ton of fun seeing them when we got his accordian signed by the Johns.  All was good until brought it up to kelly.



Me:  I wanna go to the giants!  Yay!

Her: No prob bob, when is it.

Me: Oh, its that one day.

Her: Um...sorry

Me:  ???? \*worried look\* ????

Her: You can't we have lamaze on that day.

Me: That makes me want to punch a baby!



Yep, that's exactly what happened.  Then I had to go find a baby to punch since mine wasn't readdy yet.
