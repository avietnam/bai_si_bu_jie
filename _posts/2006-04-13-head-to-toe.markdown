I got head to toe on my left leg last night.  I was surprised at first, and that sorte melted away into this smug pleased with myself feeling.  But that was shatered like a dinner plate when a contact juggling ball has been droped on it when I realized that everyone else could really care less. I have also realized a head to toe streatch is only a minor milestone on the way to kicking your self in the head.  



If tip-toe not touch fore of head, no points shall be awarded.
