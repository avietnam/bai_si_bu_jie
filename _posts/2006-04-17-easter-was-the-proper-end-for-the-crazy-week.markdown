We went to the 'dorf for Easter.  Had some good family time out there.  GSPC service was good, and it was a blast hanging back watching the round wife make the rounds. All these people who knew her growing up, and the exclamations of "oh my, look at the belly!"  I liked sneaking downstairs for the free goldfish and coffee.  



Last week was a cyclone of craziness.  We had a few people out on vacation so I was trying to fill in for them and do my normal thing.  My normal thing was pretty full for the week to start with, so I was swamped.  The beginning of the week was intense, but by Thursday I was loosing focus.  Still got what I needed to get done, but wasn't cranking through as fast as I was at the beginning of the week.  Workin' fatigue. 



Hopefully I can get some decent training in this week, I wasn't too bad last week, especially if you count the lifting.  But I am not used to the light schedule.  Stephan complained that he doesnâ€™t have a training buddy anymore now that I am never there.  Well, I think I make it 3 days a week, which to us is barely training at all.  I told him things are unlikely to improve as the year goes on.  Maybe in 5 years when Leah can go too.



I played around on MySpace and Flikr a little.  Mostly to see what all the fuss was about.  I have decided that flikr is kinda neat, and myspace is annoying.  Oh and youtube is fun when people give you positive feedback.  <a href=" http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YStVoZN9hNk">Go rate and comment</a>!
