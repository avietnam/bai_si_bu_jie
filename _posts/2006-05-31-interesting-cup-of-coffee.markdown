I got hit on this morning when I went to get coffee.  At least I think I did.



Here is what happened, you determine for your self:



After I paid I heard the girl say to her co-worker (girl 2) that she gets this one and that the other girl 2 can have that one.  I assumed it was about the two guys in suits.  Girls like guys in suits.  Girl 2 looks at me and smiles with a "she is nuts" type of look. I figure that confirms that she was talking about he guys in the suits.



But, as I am fixing my coffee she comes over and asks for my "John Hancock" on the credit card receipt.  I oblige.  Now the tricky part.  She complements my legs:

Her: You must work out ALOT! (yes, way too excited)

Me: Yeah, I do.

Her: Cause your calves are really nice.

Me: Uh, thanks.

Her: I mean, they are all like...(sound effects)...you can really see the definition.

Me: Well, hey, I appreciate it.

Her: Of course!  Have a great day!



So, maybe a polite complement, but I am 30 minus 2, so as far as I am concerned I got hit on. Even if it was a way-to-chipper coffee house girl.



Crap, now my VT hat won't fit.
