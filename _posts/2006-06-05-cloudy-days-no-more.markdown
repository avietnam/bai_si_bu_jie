Nursery is done.  Well, mostly.  Originally there were plans for fluffy clouds, and those have yet to appear, but other than that it is done.  Done and Taylor and McLaurin have clear blue skies to enjoy.

I need a better picture, I used the flash since I didn't have decent lighting or a tripod and the colors are wack.

The only way to coax a cat out of the nursery is to bribe him with a ride in the snugli.
