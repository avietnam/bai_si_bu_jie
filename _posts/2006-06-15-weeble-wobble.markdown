In the car ride into work this morning I was talking to kelly.  Here is a breif exerpt of our conversation:<br /><br />Me: Kelly, are you a weeble-wobble?<br />Her: No, I fall down.<br />Me: So your a weeble-thud?<br />Her: Yes.<br /><br />I have conversations like this all the time, yet Kelly is still nice to me.  I have no clue why.  But we did decide if we need to get weeble-wobbles for Leah we can just talk to Aimee.<br /><br /><hr /><br />Oh, and from Jiayo:<br /><br />"U.S.A is great also. Especially when Stephon Morton and Chris Sexton is representing." --batman<br /><br />Clearly the Dark Knight dosen't know what he is talking about, but it sure made my day.
