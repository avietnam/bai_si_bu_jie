Kelly tells me I qualify as a father now (and I believe the things she tells me), so I was able to celebrate Father's Day yesterday.  We had my parents and littlest sister come up and we did a little grillin and chillin.  I was able to impress the parents with Leah's room and some tasty port tenderloin.  Of course Kelly did all the real work on the tenderloin all I did was make it hot.



In the end I made out with a sweet table saw, which is still in its box in the kitchen.  The cats seem to think it makes a sweet perch. Everyone wins!
