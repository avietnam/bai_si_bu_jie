Leah Marie Sexton is here!

7lbs 6oz, 19 1/2"  Delivered by c-section at 10:58 p.m. on July 1st.

(Two more minutes and I would of won the pool!)

Both Kelly and Leah are doing well.

This being such a monumental event in my life I have tons of things to say, but I don't think I am going to get to most of them here today.

I have gotten over the initial exhaustion, that 2 hours a sleep (non continuous) a day was tuff.  Kelly handled it much better than I did, and traditionally she is much worse when functioning sleep deprived. I think I did a great job keeping my head when dealing with kelly and the baby, but noticed I was a getting short with other people.

We got home from the hospital wednesday around 4.  I have to point out that I remember seeing the other fathers leading up their new babies into the car to go home and how lucky and excited they must have been.  I had no idea how terrifying it was going to be -- because once you leave you are on your own. Just one of the many unexpected emotions of this past week.

Kelly's mom was over for much of the week helping out, and we have had a couple of people stop by and bring us food and hang out for a while.  A very welcome couple of things.  Food for the hunger and some company to ward off the cabin fever.

I had no idea how trivial my daughter would make the rest of my life seem.  I have the last big competition coming up in about a week, but that just seems silly at this point.  I am gonna try and train some this week so I can go and make her proud, but it is going to be hard. I knew I would be excited and would love her, but the actual experience is so much different that what I had thought it was going to be -- much more intense.

Agh, I am scatter brained enough right now, I am gonna go and leave you with a few pictures.  Because this proud dad likes to show off his beautiful little girl.
