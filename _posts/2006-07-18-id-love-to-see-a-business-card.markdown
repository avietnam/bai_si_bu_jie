The lactation consultant referred us to a suck evaluator.  Yes, those are their job titles.  No, I could not make that up.



Babies are funny -- so are the titles of the people that help you with them.



In other news, T minus 3 days before panams.  I am feeling pretty good, out of shape and way out of pratice, but pretty good. I think it was when Lucas grumbled something about our forms looking the same (back in the ye ole days of or prime).  So that made me feel a little better.



My knee held up pretty good, I was nervous as hell all through class and was super careful -- but I did all my nandu and everything seemed to be a-ok.  I noticed it was a bit sore today, so will continue on my cautious approach, but hopefully everything will hold up through competition. 



I don't think I want to abandon Leah and Kelly for that long so I think they have to come along.  Must smuggle baby.
