If my wife made a public service announcment, she would make <a href="http://www.nbc.com/The_Office/video/office_psa_invite.shtml#video">this</a> one.<br /><br />In other news, if you boss needs to steal your laptop because his isn't working, don't try to put your hard drive in the crappy one and see if it works for you, cause it'll only screw up your hard drive.  Then, an hour later when the boss man decides it's not working for him and gives your lappy back, you gotta reboot in safe mode and do that restore point crap.
