Tony Jaa was in DC yesterday -- a mere two blocks from my office.  He did a little demo at Woodrow Wilson Plaza.  So I took off after a work sponsored lunch to check it out.  Oddly enough I knew like 20 people there, lets hear it for wushu connections.  It was cool running into Emily and the CMAI gang plus Dennis and Co.<br /><br /><br /><img src="http://fuzzymonk.com/photos/wushu/image/595/DSC01268.JPG" class="picture" /><br />Mad props to Dennis for the picture.
