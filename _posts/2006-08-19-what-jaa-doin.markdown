Tony Jaa was in DC yesterday -- a mere two blocks from my office.  He did a little demo at Woodrow Wilson Plaza.  So I took off after a work sponsored lunch to check it out.  Oddly enough I knew like 20 people there, lets hear it for wushu connections.  It was cool running into Emily and the CMAI gang plus Dennis and Co.

Mad props to Dennis for the picture.
