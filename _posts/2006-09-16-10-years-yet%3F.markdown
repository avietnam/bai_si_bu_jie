I brought the wife and kid to richmond for my 10 year highschool reunion.  We havn't had the reunion yet, that happens in 3 hours, but that's why we are here in richmond. For added fun Nikki came back from Italy.  She came back for visa helarity, but I like to think she just wanted to see Leah.  <br /><br />Right now Leah and Kelly are happy and watching football.  Leah is talkin' bout it and smiling. So, no more blogging for me--I gots some football and women's to attend to.
