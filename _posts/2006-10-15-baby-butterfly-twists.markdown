I actually wrote the following post last week, but never had a chance to finish it.  I am been so preoccupied with life I haven't even been keeping up with reading people's blogs, much less writing my own. I had Kelly read Gerald's and give me the play by play on Nikki and Neal -- but I really have no idea what is going on in anyone else's life right 'bout now.  



Work is actually a lot of fun, we have some neat projects, possibly even some we might be able to patent (so if anyone knows how to go about that, lemme know).  Fun work is fun.



Leah has mastered rolling.  She can now do complete 360s.  I like to think of them as baby butterfly twists.

_Sleeping in her bumbo_



Last night we had a bit of baby drama.  We were up til 5 am because Kelly had to go and sneeze.  I had a hard time getting her to go down, at first I thought it was because I was trying to do with out the swaddling blanket, but hindsight says they may have been more to it.  So I finally got her a sleep thanks to the blanket and swing, and got her upstairs and settled into her bassinet, I laid down exhausted and about 15 minutes later Kelly sneezed.  Apparently Leah thought this was the scariest thing she had ever heard ever, and wanted to tell us about it, because she screamed with every thing she had. It took us two hours to get her back down.  While the sneeze may have awakened the baby, I think it was gas pains that kept her up (and possibility explained the afore mentioned trouble getting to sleep).

_Bla! Cat hair!_

It's been a while, I have been a little more than busy.  Unfortunately for you, it's not exactly the most exciting kind of busy.  At work my website went into production so I have been fielding all sorts of fun quirks with that.  Dealing with those bug fixes really gets in the way of the new development that I want to do.  



Leah Marie is still the greatest baby ever.  I think she is getting settled into her routine, of course Kelly is the on who gets up if she wakes at 3 in the morning, but she seems to be doing better and better at night.  A few potholes on the road to sleepytown, but consistent progress. She is talking more and more, and really likes to stand up and look around.  Which contrasts when we first brought her home and standing made her very sad. 



So far we are thrilled with our day care lady, she cooks for Kelly when she comes for lunch visits, and is absolutely awesome with Leah.  I don't think we could be happier. The only bad think about the situation is Kelly's work is currently her team is red lined and going insane because of it.
