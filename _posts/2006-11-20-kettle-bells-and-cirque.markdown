Long weekend, full of kettle bells and cirque.  Both were good and I am glad I spent the money to go to them -- but I hardly feel refreshed this monday.<br /><br />That was until I looked at pictures of the baby.<br /><br /><img src="http://fuzzymonk.com/photos/leah/image/595/IMG_8037.jpg" class="picture" /><br />Go Terps!<br /><br /><img src="http://fuzzymonk.com/photos/leah/image/595/IMG_8071.jpg" class="picture" /><br />Mom and Grandma make Leah happy. It's true.<br /><br /><img src="http://fuzzymonk.com/photos/leah/image/595/IMG_8059.jpg" class="picture" /><br />I heart daddy!
