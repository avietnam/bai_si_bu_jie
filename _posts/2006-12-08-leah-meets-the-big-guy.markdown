We did it, we stood in lines and paid WAY too much, but we got pictures of the baby with Santa.  The picture was snapped half a second too early, because this was the start of the smile--she had a big ol grin right after this.  Well, I don't mind if I am the one who gets the good pictures of my daughter.
