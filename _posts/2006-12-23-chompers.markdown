Leah may have shed her squeakers nickname but she has officially picked up a new one, Chompers. All the drooling and fussing and grumble cakes has produced her first tooth.  It is not all the way though, so we are still a bit grumpy, but I am certain she will have it in properly by Christmas.  Front teeth for Christmas!  Good timing baby!



She is about over he cold, about finished with this tooth almost back to her happy self.  I was getting worried we were not going to see the happy Leah again.  Normally in the morning she is all smiles, or if you lie her down in her pack and play she would dance and coo, but recently if we set her down she should immediately get mad and scream some unhappy things.  She is not back to her super happy self but we are making huge progress.
