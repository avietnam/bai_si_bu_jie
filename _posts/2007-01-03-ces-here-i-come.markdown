I am pretty psyched about going to CES--and on official business non-the-less. It'll be fun to see our stuff in action.<br /><br />Things at work have been insane while we try to get ready.  We have a few more things to polish up but we are headed off to meet up with the people to do just that, so we should be in good shape.  *knock*knock*<br /><br />Worst part is leaving the ladies for two weeks, but my trifecta of travel should keep me more than occupied. Austin, Ft. Worth and Vegas!<br /><br />Maybe, just maybe I will have some time to catch up on my log while I travel. Maybe.
