Slicer and Dicer are coming.<br /><br />Baby girl actually slept through the night last night, and I credit the Tylenol.  We had a number of mid-night wakings recently, coupled with a grumpy girl that didn't want to take her bottle when we she was going down for bed.  So we were uncertain if she was hungry and fed her in the wee hours.  But last night was a success.  And we had a happy smiley baby this morning all alert and ready to play with toys.<br /><br />I can't blame her toys are fun.<br /><br />I just wanted to tell you about the new teeth, and if anyone as any suggestions for names of teeth, please let me know.  Because I have already started down that path and it might be too late to not name them all.<br /><br />Back to CSS hell.  Holla.
