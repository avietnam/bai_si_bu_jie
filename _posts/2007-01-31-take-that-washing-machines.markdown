Our washing machine is fixed. Kelly proclaimed that I was the hero. I like that.<br /><br />Now, the lulaby that I made up for Leah:<br /><br />Hush little baby, don't say a word <br />Daddy's gonna buy you the Hokie Bird<br />And if the hokie bird don't gobble<br />daddy's gonna buy you a weeble wobble<br />And if that weeble wobble falls down<br />Daddy's gonna buy you a pretty gown<br />And if that pretty gown don't fit<br />Daddy's gonna buy you a baseball mitt<br />And if that mitt don't catch<br />Daddy's gonna buy you a wodden match<br />And if that match won't light<br />Daddy's gonna buy you a bright red kite<br />And if that Kite won't fly<br />Daddy's gonna sing you a lulaby<br />And if that lulaby don't rhyme<br />Then it must be baby girl's bed time
