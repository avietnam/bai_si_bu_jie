I spent all day thinking it was Thursday.  It is not.  It is Wednesday. <br /><br />This is actually a good thing, because I have been in a panic all day trying to get stuff done for the big project. But because of this I am in a little situation.  I made a big deal about how I wasn't going to be in the office tomorrow, ordering people around and pushing for extra help all day today.  Now tomorrow I will get "aren't you supposed to be on a plane" from everyone.  I feel so smrt.<br /><br />I feel as if I have a few options<br /><br />A) Stay home<br />B) Act like they are the crazy ones<br />C) Do lots of back tucks and aerials so they talk about that instead<br /><br />Lets go with A.
