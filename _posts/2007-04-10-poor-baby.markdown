Our poor little girl.



We took her into the doctor because she had a fever and was clearly feeling bad, and they proceeded to dig a bunch of earwax out only to find she had an ear infection.  The next week we took her back for her well visit, where they poked her with needles (she was extremely well behaved, however).  The next day her face broke out in a rash and was very congested.  You could hear it in her chest.  Fever was back.  We returned to the doc to ask about her rash.  She had another ear infection in her other ear.  What kind of crappy antibiotics was she on for the first one.  The rash turned out to be some sort of Amoxicillin induced virus, which wouldn't have broken out if she had not been on the drugs.  They gave us new antibiotics for her new ear infection and some 'good luck' for the cold and rash.  Oh, it has spread to her arms and legs now.  This has to be the worst thing as a parent ever.  I want to take it away and give it to me.
