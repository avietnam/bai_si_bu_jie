Yes, I am that leet.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I need to figure where the this dang memory leak is.  Don't mix C, C++, IE and Javascript and expect everything to behave.  <br /><br />So, no Leahtastic update right now, but don't worry it's on my list.  I got some pictures that will flip you out the back of your chair with their cuteness.<br /><br />In the mean time, django rocks (them judges won't know what hit them).
