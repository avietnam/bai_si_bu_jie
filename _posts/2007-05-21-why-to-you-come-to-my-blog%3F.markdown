Since it  has been so long since I made a real post, I could tell you about my 20+ hour coding weekend or my fun out-of-the-blue promotion or other work things but we all know you are here for one reason, and one reason only.  <br /><br />Pictures of the baby. Now, I may be wrong, and you would rather me drone on and on about wushu nonsense, but I am gonna go with my huntch, and simply leave you with Leah in photo awesomeness form.<br /><br /><br /><img src="http://fuzzymonk.com/photos/blog/image/595/IMG_1106.JPG" class="picture" /><br />There is toys in this here chest<br /><img src="http://fuzzymonk.com/photos/blog/image/595/IMG_1190.JPG" class="picture" /><br />Bath duck gets kisses.<br /><br /><img src="http://fuzzymonk.com/photos/blog/image/595/IMG_1279.JPG" class="picture" /><br />Gettin' some stars<br /><br /><img src="http://fuzzymonk.com/photos/blog/image/595/IMG_1415.JPG" class="picture" /><br />Catch Dad!<br />
