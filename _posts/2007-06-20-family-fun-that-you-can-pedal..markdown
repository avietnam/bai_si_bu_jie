<p class="MsoNormal">We went bicycle shopping yesterday, which was great fun.<span style="">  </span>If you are going to go bike shopping you should take Sean and Nina. Sean was all for it, but we had to sweeten the deal for his woman with some tasty Thai dinner.<span style="">  </span>Leah apparently had skimped on the naps, but she held up pretty well.<span style="">  </span>At REI she had plenty to look at, including a pretty pink trike with streamers to ride on, and at the restaurant we had fun stuff to eat.<span style="">  </span>By the time we got home she was super tired and wanted nothing more than to go to sleep.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal">I think I found a bike I want to get Kelly, it is pretty spiffy and Sean and Nina seem to agree that the only problem is it is overkill for our needs.<span style="">  </span>But if it is overkill and the price is not, you donâ€™t have much of a problem. I may try looking at another shop or two, but I think I may go back and pick up a present for the wife.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal">Now I am faced with the problem of what to do about a bike for myself, I have one that I got in Jr High, that was way to big for me then, and I still feel like it is too big for me now.<span style="">  </span>I would like to strip everything off and have Sean help me rebuild it from the frame up.<span style="">  </span>I may try hitting up craigslist to see if I can get a little smaller frame.<span style="">  </span>I plan on looking for one of them baby trailers there anyway. </p>
