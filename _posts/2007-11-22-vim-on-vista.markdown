Ok, so I wasted a good part of thanksgiving day trying to get vim workign again on vista.  I am not sure what happened, but it went nuts.  It may have been the recent windows updates or the face that I in stalled .NET 3.5, but it was unusable.  None of the plugins/syntax highlighting/menus that I have grown to love.  So here is what I did:<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Vim on Vista</span><br /><br />Installed gvim71-2.exe to C:\vim (<a href="http://hasno.info/2007/5/18/windows-vim-7-1-2">from here</a>)<br /><br />Copy the folling files into C:\vim\vim71\<br /><ul><li>iconv.dll (<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/gettext">from here</a> <span style="font-style: italic;">You can find the dll file in the bin directory of the "libiconv-win32" archive.</span>)</li><li>libintl.dll (<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/gettext">from here</a> <span style="font-style: italic;">Get "intl.dll" from the bin directory in the gettext-win32 archive and store it as "libintl.dll" in the same directory as gvim.exe, overwriting the file that may already be there.</span>)</li><li>gvimext.dll (<a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1720">from here</a>)<br /></li></ul>Here is the thing that stuck me for hours, if you had previously installed vim<br />to the recommended location of C:\Program Files you won't be able to associate<br />files with the new location until you edit the registry.  Go to:<br /><blockquote>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Applications\gvim.exe<br /></blockquote>Make sure the edit\command and open\command Keys have the following default value:<br /><blockquote>C:\vim\vim71\gvim.exe "%1"<br /></blockquote>If you want the  "Edit with vim" in windows explorer:<br /><ul><li> Run C:\vim\vim71\install.exe</li><li>Choose no when asked if you want to uninstall, then enter "d 14"</li></ul>If you get a gvim not in your path error with the "Edit with vim" shell ext, make sure you don't have gvim.exe set to run as Administrator, as that will break it.<br /><br />If you don't want to run around and get those files, you can download them <a href="http://www.blogger.com/files/vimvista.zip">here</a>.<br /><br />Also, I added my suite of vim files <a href="http://www.blogger.com/files/vimfiles.zip">here</a>.
