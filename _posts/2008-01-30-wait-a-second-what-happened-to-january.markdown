I am nto sure what happened to january.  I think I remember christmas, and I know there was CES, but I think that was just the other day.  Now my computer is telling me it is time we start thinking about February.  Who knew!



I have been talking every last second of my free time to geek out on rails recently.  One of our prestigious swapfriends is in town and I am stealing every bit of knowledge I possibly can while he is trying to do real work.  It is working.  I am learning alot.  Of course this process leads to me reading/coding on the train, bus, at work, over lunch and at night when I should be sleeping. Heck I even tricked people into staying after work to "ya know, hang out and code".  It worked. Yes, I asked people to volunteer to stay and continue to work after work.  They did. Sure some bailed once the pizza was gone, and a few more after a couple of beers, but we have a few rock out to the dev-tunes. 



Anytime I am not squandering away with work is family time.  I need to make sure to keep the family time top priority, because things are starting to slip, and I see it getting cut.  But it is still top in my mind.  And Leah and really become alot of fun.  She can really play now. Proper little kid playing. Make believe, rough housing, dancin', the works.  



I cannot believe how surprised I am every time she shows her abstract abilities.  A few of thing things I am the most impressed with are: Language comprehension (she can't say it, but she knows what the elephant is, and how to find the matching shoe when you ask), imagination (changing dolly's diaper, dressing up like mom), and trying to manipulate her parents (Yeah, I normally see though it, I just sometimes let it happen -- it is just easier).  I am sure all parents out there are equally astonished, but can't understand how abstract thought can be learned, but I am watching it happen right in front of my eyes.  Teh cool.
