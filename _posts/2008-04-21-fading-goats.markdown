I really think fuzzymonk.com is way over due for an update, something to simplify things, but don't think I am going to get any time to deal with that any time soon.  Would really like to migrate the cookbook and dictionary to rails.  Would be stupid easy.<br /><br />We just got back from Colin Hay.  Was our second time seeing him at the Birchmere, he was every bit as good as he was last time.  We even had an extra ticket so were able to drag my esteemed colleague from the west out.  I think everyone had a good time, nice chill show with some funny enter-song commentary. <br /><br />I think the best part of the evening was coming home to and having our delightful babysitter, Mer, tell us how wonderful our daughter is.  We always worry she won't be good for other people, if for no other reason because we want them to come back and babysit again.  But our worries were for nothing, and she was sweet as could be.  Apparently liberal with the kisses and hugs, as well as easily entertained and didn't mind going to bed.  Score one for the little Sexton girl.<br /><br />Oh, that silly girl:<br /><br /><img src="http://fuzzymonk.com/photos/blog/image/595/IMG_5911.JPG" class="picture" /><br />Pretty dress on a pretty day<br /><br /><img src="http://fuzzymonk.com/photos/blog/image/595/IMG_5907.JPG" class="picture" /><br />Cookin' in the kitchen
