I've been trying to get everything organized recently.  I tend to go through waves of hyper-organization to utter disregard to keeping track of stuff. Now that work is all over the place on a consistent basis I need to be consistently organized. <br /><br />My problem is I am all over the place.  I use outlook and my blackberry for work stuff, and out look is running on my mac in a VM.  Personal stuff I use gmail and gcal, which is nicely integrated with my wife's calendar (which is important, b/c she normally knows when I need to be places before I do).  Personal Calendar and email stuff I integrate with the iCal through <a href="http://www.google.com/support/calendar/bin/answer.py?answer=99358">CalDav</a>, and Mail.app hearts IMAP.
