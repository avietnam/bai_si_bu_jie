Ok, so it doesn't really feel like I've had much perspective at all in the last 24 hours, but I'm much more stable now and figure the whole burden of documenting our family life shouldn't fall to Chris.<br /><br />About this time yesterday I was very contentedly sitting in my hospital bed, holding my darling new son and feeling on top of the world.  I was actually quite pleased with myself for how much more natural everything was coming this time, how I wasn't stressed out, etc. <br /><br />And then, my world came crashing down around me.  And fast.<br /><br />We went from a routine and seemingly successful check up with the lactation consultant to bring in neonatologists from the NICU for evaluations of Laurence's breathing.  O2 monitors, CBC testing, blood sugar testing, chest X-rays, and mandatory nursery time where the nurses could watch him at all times.<br /><br />I saw enough of what happened with our youngest nephew to be thoroughly freaked out even though I knew it turned out perfectly ok in the end for him.  And I could easily be a professional worrier.  So this was a pretty darn perfect storm for me.  I was fairly inconsolable.  For a while things seemed to be getting worse, but by evening Laurence stabalized<br /><br /><br />
