Things have been going well.  Laurence is starting to have some awake and alert time, however it tends to be between 11 PM and 3 AM.  So his mom and I are coping with that.  When he was born he was clearly too small for his skin, but finally starting to fill it in.  Still seems super tiny when his giant sister is around.  <br /><br />Speaking of which, she is doing well.  Had this kid around for a while and she still likes him. A bit cranky in the pants but other than that very fun to be around.  I can't wait till she gets a chance to teach her brother all the fun games she knows.<br /><br /><img src="http://fuzzymonk.com/photos/blog/image/595/IMG_6882.JPG" class="picture" /><br />Our very first bath, and it is a sad one.<br /><br /><img src="http://fuzzymonk.com/photos/blog/image/595/IMG_6896.JPG" class="picture" /><br />Having snacks with big sis.<br /><br /><img src="http://fuzzymonk.com/photos/blog/image/595/IMG_6927.JPG" class="picture" /><br />Sleeping hard on mom.<br /><br /><img src="http://fuzzymonk.com/photos/blog/image/595/IMG_6928.JPG" class="picture" /><br />Zonk.<br />
