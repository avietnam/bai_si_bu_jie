When putting Leah down for her naps or bedtime we sing songs, we have gotten to the point where we ask her what songs she wants to sing. This is how that conversation normally goes:



Dad: OK Leah, we can sing 3 songs, what song do you want to sing first?

Leah: Itsy Spider

Dad: Itsy Bitsy Spider it is.

[singing]

Dad: OK Leah, we can sing 2 more songs, what song do you want to sing next?

Leah: Football!

Dad: How about Hush Little Baby?

Leah: No. Football!

Dad: [singing]Hush little ba---

Leah: FOOTBALL!

Dad: Um. Ba budda baaa!....



Who taught her that football was a song? Cause they can do bedtime next.
