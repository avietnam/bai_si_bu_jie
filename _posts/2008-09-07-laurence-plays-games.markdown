Kelly has discovered that Laurence can play a few games.  Not nearly as advanced as Leah was when I blogged about <a href="http://www.fuzzymonk.com/chris/log/2006/09/games-leah-plays.php">her games</a>, but he plays them all the same.

Leah had an interesting nap earlier. I went up to check on her to see if she was still asleep to find a very sheepish little girl missing a diaper. I smelled a bit of an odor, and noticed the diaper folded up on the floor.  Sure enough she took her dirty diaper off and went back to bed. I can't blame her one bit--I wouldn't want to sleep in that either.  She even got the wipes and cleaned her self up.  Sure we _may_ need to run the comforter through the wash, but for a two year old I was impressed.



Backing up the MacBook is bogging down the network so much that our IP phones are choppy. It also makes the compy pretty hot.
