_Guest post by Kelly_

This week was a hard week. About this time last Sunday my brother informed me that while I was at church my parents had called to say that my Grandma Lawson had passed away.  We’d been expecting it for a week so it wasn’t a shock, but it was still quite sad.  She was my last grandparent.  My mom had to play family peacemaker on top of grieving for her mother.  Grandma never met Laurence.  I certainly didn’t call or write often enough.  And I had to explain death to Leah somehow since she had just seen my Grandma the month before and talked about her regularly.

The viewing was Tuesday night and I saw lots of family I hadn’t seen in a while.  Services were first thing Wednesday morning and they were nicely done.  And the kids brought some joy to an otherwise sad occasion.

None of this was the hard part of the week.  Well, maybe telling Leah about death was hard.

The hard part of the week was the constant trials and tribulations thrown in our path from a logistical point of view.  Here are just a few of the challenges we faced:



 \* Chris was in SFO, leaving me to single parent it while I planned and packed – I did tell him to go ahead and go, but still, it’s harder when he’s not around

 \* The garage at DCA is under construction and impossible to navigate

 \* The check-in machines for American don’t deal well with split parties

 \* Renting two cars from someone who didn’t realize we wanted two separate cars

 \* Reconciling TomTom’s instructions and my dad’s pre-planned routes

 \* Finding places to eat that are both kid friendly and dad friendly

 \* Sharing a hotel room with two kids who have different nap schedules

 \* The bazillion outlets and drawers in said hotel room that Lars was magnetically drawn to

 \* The tornados

 \* The 3:00 a.m. fire alarm – which the fire department didn’t show up to turn off until 3:30

 \* Locking myself out of the room during the fire alarm while Lars was still inside and I didn’t yet know it was a false alarm

 \* And of course the “moving the Russian Army” sized task of flying with two small kids half way across the country


And there was more to be sure, but I’m already placing a mental block on a lot of this past week.  My bother and parents suffered through all of this with us Sextons and each had their own things to add to the list.  None of us, except my mom, handled every situation with grace, but we were all still speaking to each other when we got home, and I think we’ll even be willing to hang out together again sometime soon.

So, hopefully this next week will be kinder to us all.  We could sure use the break.

God bless you Grandma, we miss you lots, and you were worth every little bit of trouble that we went through!
