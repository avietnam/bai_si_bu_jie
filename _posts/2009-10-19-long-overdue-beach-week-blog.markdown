I think letting this much time pass after beach week before writing the blog was a bad thing. Now that it has been a while it feels like it was a good vacation. It wasn't. Everyone got sick, it was fairly cold, and I never ate an actual burger form dune burger.

Well, about halfway through the week I started taking score. This pretty much sums up the week.

Beach week score

  \* 1 - 102Â° fever
  \* 1 - Vomit covered couch
  \* 1 - Diaper rash so bad it bled
  \* 1 - Not quite severed finger
  \* 5 - Peoples less than healthy
  \* 2 - Trips to the doctor
  \* 1 - Rescued frog from the pool
  \* 2 - Not quite so rescued crabs from pool
  \* 0 - Nights of solid sleep
  \* 5 - Trips to dune burger
  \* 3 - Trips to Kitty Hawk
  \* 1 - Never ending smoke alarm
  \* 1 - Foot splinter the size of a tooth pick
  \* 0 - Drownings
  \* 3 - Lbs of bacon
  \* 3 - Sub par offers on our house
  \* 1 - Termite damaged bath room (@ Belgrave)
  \* 25 - Muchkins
  \* 1 - Gate injury
  \* 1 - Fence Injury
  \* 1 - Poo stain on the carpet
  \* 1 - Case of vertigo
  \* 1 - Fly up the nose
  \* 1 - Cube of beef in the ear
  \* N - High centered senors on baby gates
  \* 1 - Cat unresponsive to antibiotics
  \* 0 - Exploding oil pans on I-295

Clearly there is plenty to be grateful on that list, but plenty that made for a less than ideal vacation.

Still, it is nice to have a photogenic set o' kids:
