The following reasons occurred between My birthday and now. And they are the evidence that I can't win:

Got a mouse in the car. Tore up the kids car seats (ate clean through the harness straps), chewed large holes in the leather seats, pooped.

Leah went to the doctor twice for a high fever, diagnosed with "generic virus"

Put out glue traps for the mouse, he ate the peanut butter off of them.

Leah missed nearly everyday of school last week, threw her schedule way off.

Set traditional snap traps for the mouse, set one off and ate the peanut butter off of it.

Disassembled the inside of the car, removed the back seat, console and most of the dash. Unable to find the mouse.

The TV decided it did not want to be off, it now randomly turns on. Magically. *

Tried to take Leah to the Doc to look at her ears, got slammed in the post-HOV rush on I-66 and was late.

Friends got sick had to cancel date night, but still had a baby sitter.

Leah does have an ear infection.

Been 5 days since any bait was taken in the car, assuming a dead mouse hidden in the cabin somewhere.

Lars' Nanny called and said his fever was up.

Got the replacement parts for the car seats and it appears the 'harness strap kit' does not contain the 'harness adjustment strap'.


* I removed the batteries from the remote, and unpluged the hdmi cable, it still did it. Eventually I had to unplug the set. I even closed the blinds to make sure the neighbors were not playing jokes on us. At 7:45 AM.
