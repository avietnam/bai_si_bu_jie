We got quite the snow storm here. I am not sure what the official snowfall is, but we had spots in our yard that were 2' deep. We spent about 45 minutes getting ready (and they were very sad minutes, near constant crying), but once we got them out in the snow it was much happier. 

Made a snow house with snow chairs, including a daddy sized one that mommy squished into a snow shea's lounge. I also discovered that Leah loves to get people to make snowballs for her, but as soon as you do you get hit by said snowball.

What are you doing to me, dad?

Not something *I* want to clear off.
