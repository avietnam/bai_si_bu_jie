Just picked up Leah and Lars and I was headed home. I popped in a CD with their music and the following conversation ensued:

<b>Leah</b>: Is this Imagination Movers? <br/>
<b>Me</b>: Yes it is. <br/>
<b>Leah</b>: I like Imaganation Movers, can we listen to it loud? <br />
<i>*turns up radio*</i><br />
<b>Me</b>: ARE YOU ROCKING OUT?"<br />
<b>Leah</b>: WHAT YOU SAY? WHAT?<br />
<i>*turns down radio*</i><br />
<b>Me</b>: When you want to ask someone what they said you should say "Can you please tell me what you said?"<br />
<b>Leah</b>: I SAID WHAT!<br />
<b>Me</b>: No, when you ask someone that you should say "Can you tell me what you said, please?"<br />
<b>Leah</b>: I SAID WHAT!<br />
<b>Me</b>: YOU need to say "Can you tell me what you said, please?"<br />
<b>Leah</b>: I SAID WHAT!<br />
<i>*turns up radio*</i><br />
