Just picked up Leah and Lars and I was headed home. I popped in a CD with their music and the following conversation ensued:

**Leah**: Is this Imagination Movers? 


**Me**: Yes it is. 


**Leah**: I like Imaganation Movers, can we listen to it loud? 


_\*turns up radio\*_


**Me**: ARE YOU ROCKING OUT?"


**Leah**: WHAT YOU SAY? WHAT?


_\*turns down radio\*_


**Me**: When you want to ask someone what they said you should say "Can you please tell me what you said?"


**Leah**: I SAID WHAT!


**Me**: No, when you ask someone that you should say "Can you tell me what you said, please?"


**Leah**: I SAID WHAT!


**Me**: YOU need to say "Can you tell me what you said, please?"


**Leah**: I SAID WHAT!


_\*turns up radio\*_
