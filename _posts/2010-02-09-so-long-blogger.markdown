Hello [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll).

I've been using blogger.com for this website since 2002, but they are understandibly dropping support for ftp publishing next month, so I need to move on. I have been using Jekyll for other projects, so I thought I woudl give it a go for this one.

Technical details aside, if you notice anything missing please post a comment. I have move most everything around, so that might cause some confustion. But I am trying to clean everything up in the process. The biggest change (that people will actually care about) is moving the pictures from `fuzzymonk.com/photos` to `photos.fuzzymonk.com`. Most everything should still be accessable from the links on the sidebar.
