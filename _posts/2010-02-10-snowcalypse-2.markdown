We are in the middle so Snowcalypse 2.

It is getting to the point that I am starting to worry about my roof. 

I have been trapped in the house nearly all week. Snowcalypse 1 (or as I like to call it Snowcalypse  Prime) hit us 5 days ago, and here we are watching it come down hard again.

Earlier this week the streets were clear enough to get out around McLean, but when I tried to get into work yesterday I was thwarted by jackknifed tractor trailers and bulldozers blocking traffic while they shuffled snow piles around. Turns out metro was running all above ground trains at 10 MPH anyway, so I think it was a good idea to just stay put. We were able to shuffle the kids off to their old nanny for the day. 

It has been tough wrangling the kids and trying to stay somewhat productive at work. It would be hard enough if Kelly was spending full time watching them, but she has urgent work to deal with as well -- so basically nobody gets anything done. 

Over the weekend--before I destroyed my back shoveling--I was able to take Leah out and play in the snow. I don't think I had ever heard her laugh that hard and that long before. She thought it was the greatest thing. We would build snow houses, make snow cakes and eat snow cookies. She is also a big fan of throwing snowballs, however she hasn't figured out how to make them yet. So I have to make them for her, I hand it over and she immediately throws it at me. Of course she thinks this might be one of the funniest things ever. 

I think the shoveling for Prime was going well until the plows closed off the drive way with a 4' high bank of solid packed snow boulders. That required a garden shovel to break it apart. 

I have begun experiments on how to prep the cars for the snow. In Prime i cut up cardboard boxes and covered the car windshields. Which resulted in very little ice scraping when I did get the massive pile of snow off. Our current storm I decided to try covering the entire car with a tarp. Assuming it does not freeze to the car itself, I think this could just work.

time to sneak in a little more work. Lars is napping, and Kelly and Leah are snuggling on the couch watching Curious George. This is a _rare_ quiet time.

Yeah, that's a lot of snow.
